The two F-15 fighter jets that took off from Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod head toward the New York area. But accounts will be unclear regarding what speed they fly at as they respond to the hijacking of Flight 11. The two jets were scrambled from Otis at 8:46 (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846scramble)), and are airborne by 8:53 (see [8:53 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a852otistakeoff)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 20][1]]

**Flying Supersonic** - In a number of accounts, it is claimed the fighters fly faster than the speed of sound. [[Cape Cod Times, 8/21/2002][2]] Lead pilot Lt. Col. Timothy Duffy will tell the BBC: "I was supersonic.… I don't know what we could have done to get there any quicker." [[BBC, 9/1/2002][3]] He tells ABC News, "[W]e go supersonic on the way, which is kind of nonstandard for us." [[ABC News, 9/11/2002][14]] According to author Lynn Spencer, "against regulations, [Duffy] takes his plane supersonic, breaking the sound barrier as he passes through 18,000 feet. This is a violation that can get a pilot into a good deal of trouble since the sonic boom tends to break windows in the homes down below." When the other Otis pilot, Major Daniel Nash, radios and says, "You're supersonic," Duffy responds, "Yeah, I know, don't worry about it." Then, "Without hesitation, [Nash] follows his lead" and also goes supersonic. [[Spencer, 2008, pp. 43][4]]

**Flying 'Full Blower'** - Duffy will recall, "I was in full blower all the way," as he flies toward New York. [[Aviation Week and Space Technology, 6/3/2002][5]] In another account, he similarly says, "When we took off I left it in full afterburner the whole time." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 57][6]] F-15s can fly at up to 1,875 miles per hour. [[Cape Cod Times, 9/12/2001][7]; [US Air Force, 3/2008][8]] According to an Otis Air Base spokeswoman, "An F-15 departing from Otis can reach New York City in 10 to 12 minutes." [[Cape Cod Times, 9/16/2001][9]] But, according to the Boston Globe, while "In their prime, the planes can go Mach 2.5 [and] could have been to New York in less than 10 minutes," Duffy and Nash are "flying F-15 Eagles that were built in 1977.… Because of their age and the three large fuel tanks they were carrying… the planes couldn't attain that speed, both pilots said." [[Boston Globe, 9/11/2005][10]]

**Different Speeds Given** - Various speeds will later be given for how fast the Otis jets are traveling. Consistent with Duffy's claims of flying "supersonic," ABC News says the two fighters fly "at Mach 1.2, nearly 900 miles per hour." [[ABC News, 9/11/2002][14]] According to the Boston Globe, the fighters are flying at "about Mach 1.4—more than 1,000 miles per hour." [[Boston Globe, 9/11/2005][10]] Major General Larry Arnold, the commanding general of NORAD's Continental Region, says they fly at "about 1.5 Mach, which is, you know, somewhere—11 or 1,200 miles an hour." [[Slate, 1/16/2002][11]] Major General Paul Weaver, the director of the Air National Guard, says the jets fly "like a scalded ape," but as to their exact speed, he only says they are "topping 500 mph." [[Dallas Morning News, 9/16/2001][12]] And by 9:03 a.m., when the second World Trade Center tower is hit, the Otis fighters are still 71 miles from New York, according to NORAD. [[North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][13]] The 9/11 Commission will state that they only arrive over Manhattan at 9:25 a.m. (see [9:25 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a925fightersarrive)), though accounts of most witnesses on the ground indicate they do not arrive until after 10:00 a.m. (see [(9:45 a.m.-10:45 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a945fightersnoticed)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 24][1]] Accounts are contradictory regarding what exact destination the Otis jets are initially heading toward after taking off (see [(8:53 a.m.-9:05 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a852otisscramble)).
