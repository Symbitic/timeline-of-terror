According to the 9/11 Commission, Flight 175 is hijacked some time between 8:42 "when its flight crew make their last communication with the ground" and 8:46. The Commission describes that the hijackers "used knives (as reported by two passengers and a flight attendant), Mace (reported by one passenger), and the threat of a bomb (reported by the same passenger). They stabbed members of the flight crew (reported by a flight attendant and one passenger). Both pilots had been killed (reported by one flight attendant)." These witness accounts come from phone calls made from the rear of the plane, from passengers who'd been assigned seats in the front or middle of the cabin. According to the Commission, this is "a sign that passengers and perhaps crew [are] moved to the back of the aircraft." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 7][1]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 20][2]] An employee at the FAA's Boston Center later says the hijacking occurs when Flight 175 is above Albany, NY, about 140 miles north of New York City. [[Telegraph (Nashua), 9/12/2001][3]; [Associated Press, 9/13/2001][4]] The first "operational evidence" that something is wrong is at 8:47, when Flight 175's transponder code changes twice within a minute.
