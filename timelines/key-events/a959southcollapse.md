The South Tower of the World Trade Center tilts to the southeast and then collapses. It was hit by Flight 175 at 9:03 a.m., 56 minutes earlier (see [9:03 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903flight175crashes)). [[Washington Post, 9/12/2001][1]; [New York Times, 9/12/2001][2]; [MSNBC, 9/22/2001][3]; [USA Today, 12/20/2001][4]; [Associated Press, 8/21/2002][5]; [ABC News, 9/11/2002][6]; [National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 44][7]] The first sign of the collapse is visible on floor 82. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 87][7]] The angle of the tilt will be disputed after 9/11, as will the time it takes the towers to fall to the ground.
