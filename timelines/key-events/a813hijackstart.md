The last routine communication takes place between air traffic control and the pilots of Flight 11 at 8:13 and 29 seconds. Boston Center air traffic controller Pete Zalewski is handling the flight, and instructs it to turn 20 degrees to the right. Pilot John Ogonowski immediately acknowledges the instruction, but seconds later he fails to respond to a command to climb to 35,000 feet. Zalewski repeatedly tries to reach the pilot over the next ten minutes, even using the emergency frequency, but gets no response (see [8:14 a.m.-8:24 a.m. September 11, 2001][6]). The 9/11 Commission concludes that Flight 11 is hijacked at 8:14, or shortly afterwards (see [8:14 a.m. September 11, 2001][5]).
