A training exercise is scheduled to begin at a US intelligence agency located just over 20 miles from the Pentagon, based around the scenario of a small corporate jet plane experiencing a mechanical failure and crashing into a tower building there. The exercise, which has been planned for several months, is to take place at the headquarters of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in Chantilly, Virginia, four miles away from Washington Dulles International Airport and 24 miles from the Pentagon. [[Associated Press, 8/21/2002][1]; [United Press International, 8/22/2002][2]] Its purpose is to test the agency's employees' ability to respond to a small aircraft crash.

**Simulated Plane Crash** - The exercise is set to commence at 9:00 a.m., when its observers meet to be briefed. The observers and exercise role players are to move to their positions for the exercise 10 to 15 minutes later. The plane in the exercise scenario is a Learjet 35A with two pilots and four passengers on board, which takes off at 9:30 a.m. from Dulles Airport. [[9/11 Commission, 7/14/2003][3]] This is the airport Flight 77, which crashes into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., took off from earlier in the morning (see [8:20 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a820takeoff)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 8-10][4]] A minute after taking off, the Learjet is supposed to experience a mechanical failure. It then goes out of control, leading it to crash into one of the four towers at the NRO's headquarters at around 9:32 a.m. (see [9:30 a.m.-10:30 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a930crashscenario)). No real plane is going to be used in the exercise, but some stairwells and exits at the NRO headquarters are to be closed off in order to simulate the damage from the crash, forcing employees to find other ways to evacuate the building.

**Scenario Created by War Gaming Division** - The exercise scenario was imagined by the NRO's internal war gaming division. [[United Press International, 8/22/2002][2]] The exercise is being run by John Fulton, the chief of this division, and his team at the CIA.

**Highly Secretive Agency** - The NRO is an agency of the US Department of Defense. Its mission is "to ensure that the US has the technology and spaceborne and airborne assets needed to acquire intelligence worldwide." [[US Department of Defense, 9/18/1992][7]] It operates many of the nation's spy satellites. [[Associated Press, 8/21/2002][1]] According to the New York Times, "It designs, builds, and operates spy satellites that photograph and overhear what other countries are up to." [[New York Times, 8/10/1994][8]] The NRO employs some 3,000 people. These employees are drawn from the CIA and the military. [[Associated Press, 8/21/2002][1]] The New York Times has called the NRO "probably the most secretive of the intelligence agencies." Until 1992, its existence was not even officially disclosed. [[New York Times, 8/10/1994][8]]

**Exercise Canceled** - According to NRO spokesman Art Haubold, the exercise will be called off "as soon as real world events began to unfold." However, he does not give a specific time. All but the NRO's most essential employees will then be sent home. [[United Press International, 8/22/2002][2]] Haubold will later comment, "It was just an incredible coincidence" that the exercise scenario "happened to involve an aircraft crashing into our facility."
