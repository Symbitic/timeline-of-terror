According to a statement by two high-level FAA officials, "Within minutes after the first aircraft hit the World Trade Center, the FAA immediately established several phone bridges [i.e., telephone conference calls] that included FAA field facilities, the FAA command center, FAA headquarters, [Defense Department], the Secret Service, and other government agencies." The FAA shares "real-time information on the phone bridges about the unfolding events, including information about loss of communication with aircraft, loss of transponder signals, unauthorized changes in course, and other actions being taken by all the flights of interest, including Flight 77. Other parties on the phone bridges in turn shared information about actions they were taken." The statement says, "The US Air Force liaison to the FAA immediately joined the FAA headquarters phone bridge and established contact with NORAD on a separate line." [[9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][1]] Another account says the phone bridges are "quickly established" by the Air Traffic Services Cell (ATSC). This is a small office at the FAA's Herndon Command Center, which is staffed by three military officers at the time of the attacks (see [(Between 9:04 a.m. and 9:25 a.m.) September 11, 2001]). It serves as the center's liaison with the military. According to Aviation Week and Space Technology, the phone bridges link "key players, such as NORAD's command center, area defense sectors, key FAA personnel, airline operations, and the NMCC." [[Aviation Week and Space Technology, 6/10/2002][2]; [9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][3]] According to an FAA transcript of employee conversations on 9/11, one of the phone bridges, between the FAA Command Center, the operations center at FAA headquarters, and air traffic control centers in Boston and New York, begins before Flight 11 hits the World Trade Center at 8:46 (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001]). [[Federal Aviation Administration, 10/14/2003, pp. 3-10][4]] If these accounts are correct, it means someone at NORAD should learn about Flight 77 when it deviates from its course (see [(8:54 a.m.) September 11, 2001]). However, the 9/11 Commission will later claim that the FAA teleconference is established about 30 minutes later (see [(9:20 a.m.) September 11, 2001]). The Air Force liaison to the FAA will claim she only joins it after the Pentagon is hit (see [(Shortly After 9:37 a.m.) September 11, 2001]).
