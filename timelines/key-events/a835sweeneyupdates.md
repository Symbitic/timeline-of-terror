Amy Sweeney, a flight attendant on Flight 11, reaches the American Airlines flight services office at Logan International Airport in Boston for the third time, and, in a phone call lasting 12 or 13 minutes, gives details of the trouble on her plane to a manager there. [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 11][1]; [US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, 7/31/2006][2]] Sweeney has already called the flight services office two times and provided employees there with details of the hijacking of Flight 11, but both calls were cut off after a short time.

**Manager Takes Over Answering Call** - At 8:32 a.m., Sweeney reaches the office for the third time. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 6][3]; [US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, 7/31/2006][2]] The call is answered by James Sayer, a staff assistant. But Sayer tells Michael Woodward, an American Airlines flight services manager at Logan Airport, that the caller is Sweeney, and Woodward then takes over the call. Woodward is friends with Sweeney and has known her personally for 10 years. Furthermore, Woodward will tell the 9/11 Commission, Sayer is not trained to handle emergency calls. Woodward asks Sweeney, "Amy, sweetie, what's going on?" She replies, "Listen to me very, very carefully." Realizing that Sweeney is going to give him important information, Woodward immediately begins taking notes.

**Sweeney Provides Details of Hijacking** - Woodward will tell the 9/11 Commission that, in a matter-of-fact and official manner, Sweeney then describes to him the trouble on her plane. She says she is sitting in the back of the aircraft next to Betty Ong, another flight attendant, and the two of them are trying to relay as much information as they can to people on the ground. She says her plane has been hijacked, a man in first class had his throat slashed, and two flight attendants—Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui—have been stabbed. Sweeney says that Martin isn't doing very well and is on oxygen, but Arestegui is less seriously injured and seems to be alright. She says the hijackers have gained entry into the cockpit, though she doesn't say how they did this, and there is a bomb in the cockpit. She makes no comments about the condition of the pilots, but says the flight attendants are unable to contact the cockpit. Later in the conversation, she says she doesn't think the original pilot is in control of the plane, because they are flying "all over the place." [[9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][4]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 11-12][1]]

**Sweeney Gives Seat Numbers of Hijackers** - Sweeney apparently believes there are only three hijackers on Flight 11. She tells Woodward that the people who hijacked her plane were in seats 9D, 9G, and 10B. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001, pp. 5-6][5]; [9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][4]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 14][1]] However, apart from seat 10B, these are different seats to those assigned to the hijackers on the tickets they purchased. [[Los Angeles Times, 9/20/2001][6]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 2][3]] Sweeney tells Woodward that the hijackers are of Middle Eastern descent. She says one of them spoke excellent English and another spoke very little English. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 1-2][5]; [9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][4]]

**Doctor or Nurse Requested** - Woodward will say, when he is first questioned by the FBI about Sweeney's call, that Sweeney tells him that a doctor and nurse are caring for the passenger who had his throat slashed. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001, pp. 5-6][5]] But Ong, who is on the phone with employees at the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in North Carolina, says there are no doctors on Flight 11. [[American Airlines, 9/11/2001, pp. 7-19][8]; [9/11 Commission, 1/27/2004][9]] However, in a second interview with the FBI and in his interview with the 9/11 Commission, Woodward will say only that a doctor or nurse has been paged.

**Woodward Gives Contradictory Accounts of Type of Phone Used** - Woodward hears no noise in the background during his conversation with Sweeney. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 1-2][5]; [9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][4]] The information Sweeney provides about the hijacking has been given to her by Sara Low, a flight attendant who was assigned to the front of Flight 11 and so would have witnessed the hijacking when it happened. [[Boston Herald, 12/15/2008][10]; [Associated Press, 3/5/2009][11]] In interviews with the FBI, Woodward will say that Sweeney makes the call using an Airfone, or that he is unsure whether she uses an Airfone or a cell phone. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001, pp. 5-6][5]; [Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 1-2][5]] But he will tell the 9/11 Commission that she makes the call on a cell phone. [[9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][4]] However, the FBI will state that Sweeney is using an Airfone. [[9/11 Commission, 2004, pp. 4][12]; [New York Observer, 6/20/2004][13]; [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 9/11/2011][14]] There is no tape machine in the flight services office, and so her call is not recorded. [[9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][4]; [New York Observer, 6/20/2004][13]]

**Airline Contacted about Call** - At 8:40 a.m., one of Woodward's colleagues in the flight services office calls the American Airlines System Operations Control center in Fort Worth, Texas, and passes on to it the information that Sweeney is providing to Woodward. Sweeney's call ends after 12 or 13 minutes. [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 11, 14][1]; [US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, 7/31/2006][2]]
