The two F-15 fighter jets launched from Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod respond to the hijacking of Flight 11, but there will be conflicting accounts regarding their initial destination. The fighters were scrambled at 8:46 (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846scramble)), and are airborne by 8:53 (see [8:53 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a852otistakeoff)).

**Flying toward New York City** - News reports shortly after 9/11 will say that, after taking off, the Otis fighters begin "racing towards New York City." [[CBS News, 9/14/2001]; [CNN, 9/14/2001][2]; [Cape Cod Times, 9/15/2001][3]] Other news reports similarly say they initially head toward New York City. [[Washington Post, 9/12/2001][4]; [Aviation Week and Space Technology, 6/3/2002][5]; [Fox News, 9/8/2002][6]] Major General Larry Arnold, the commanding general of NORAD's Continental Region, will say the fighters are "coming to New York." [[MSNBC, 9/23/2001]; [Slate, 1/16/2002][7]] Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy, the lead Otis pilot, tells the BBC, "When we took off we started climbing a 280-heading, basically towards New York City." [[BBC, 9/1/2002][8]] In one account, Duffy recalls that, after launching, he calls for the location of his target and is told, "Your contact's over Kennedy," meaning New York's JFK International Airport. Duffy will add, "[W]e started heading right down to Long Island, basically." [[ABC News, 9/11/2002]; [Bamford, 2004, pp. 15][9]] In another account, he says that he and the other Otis pilot, Major Daniel Nash, "climbed up, [and] we were supersonic going down to Long Island." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 57][10]]

**Without a Target, Heading for Military Airspace** - According to some accounts, however, the two Otis fighters do not initially head toward Manhattan. Major James Fox, the leader of the weapons team at NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS), will later recall: "We had no idea where [Flight 11] was. We just knew it was over land, so we scrambled [the Otis fighters] towards land." [[Newhouse News Service, 1/25/2002][11]] The 9/11 Commission will conclude that, after taking off, because they are "Lacking a target," the fighters are "vectored toward military-controlled airspace off the Long Island coast." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 20][1]] Colonel Robert Marr, the battle commander at NEADS, says that when the Otis fighters took off, his "intent was to scramble [them] to military airspace while we found out what was going on." He says that, before 9:03 a.m. when the second World Trade Center tower is hit, the fighters are "heading down south toward Whiskey 105 and we don't really have a mission for them at this point." Whiskey 105 is military training airspace southeast of Long Island, a few minutes flying time from New York City. [[Filson, 2003, pp. 56 and 58-59][10]]

**To New York, Then Redirected to Military Airspace** - Other accounts will say the Otis fighters initially head toward New York City, but are subsequently redirected to the military airspace off Long Island (see [8:54 a.m.-8:55 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a854newheading)). According to author Lynn Spencer, after taking off, Duffy and Nash fly "supersonic toward New York for approximately 15 minutes." But just after the second WTC tower is hit, Duffy suggests to the weapons controller at NEADS that the two fighters head to the Whiskey 105 training airspace off Long Island, and that is where they then go. [[Spencer, 2008, pp. 83-85][12]] Tape recordings of the NEADS operations floor will reveal that, at 8:45 a.m., Major Kevin Nasypany, the facility's mission crew commander, gave Major Fox a coordinate north of New York City, and told him to "Head [the Otis jets] in that direction" (see [8:45 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a845neadsorders)). Then, at 8:52, he told one of his staff members, "Send 'em to New York City still" (see [8:53 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a852otistakeoff)). But, according to Vanity Fair, shortly after the second tower is hit, the NEADS weapons technicians get "pushback" from civilian FAA controllers, who are "afraid of fast-moving fighters colliding with a passenger plane," so the two fighters are directed to a "holding area" just off the coast, near Long Island (see [9:09 a.m.-9:13 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a908overocean)). [[Vanity Fair, 8/1/2006][13]] Accounts are also unclear regarding what speed the Otis jets fly at after taking off (see [(8:53 a.m.-9:05 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a853flytowardny)).
