According to the 9/11 Commission, NEADS is contacted by the FAA's Boston Center. Colin Scoggins, Boston Center's military liaison, tells it: "I just had a report that American 11 is still in the air, and it's on its way towards—heading towards Washington.… That was another—it was evidently another aircraft that hit the tower. That's the latest report we have.… I'm going to try to confirm an ID for you, but I would assume he's somewhere over, uh, either New Jersey or somewhere further south." The NEADS official asks: "He—American 11 is a hijack?… And he's heading into Washington?" Scoggins answers yes both times and adds, "This could be a third aircraft." Somehow Boston Center has been told by FAA headquarters that Flight 11 is still airborne, but the 9/11 Commission will say it hasn't been able to find where this mistaken information came from. 

**Scoggins Makes Error** - Vanity Fair magazine will later add, "In Boston, it is Colin Scoggins who has made the mistaken call." Scoggins will explain why he believes he made this error: "With American Airlines, we could never confirm if [Flight 11] was down or not, so that left doubt in our minds." He says he was monitoring a conference call between FAA centers (see [8:28 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a828conferencecall)), "when the word came across—from whom or where isn't clear—that American 11 was thought to be headed for Washington." However, Boston Center was never tracking Flight 11 on radar after losing sight of it near Manhattan: "The plane's course, had it continued south past New York in the direction it was flying before it dipped below radar coverage, would have had it headed on a straight course toward DC. This was all controllers were going on." Scoggins says, "After talking to a supervisor, I made the call and said [American 11] is still in the air."

**Myers Refers to Mistaken Report** - In the hours following the attacks, acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers will apparently refer to this erroneous report that Flight 11 is still airborne and heading toward Washington, telling the Associated Press that "prior to the crash into the Pentagon, military officials had been notified that another hijacked plane had been heading from the New York area to Washington." Myers will say "he assumed that hijacked plane was the one that hit the Pentagon, though he couldn't be sure." [[Associated Press, 9/11/2001][4]]
