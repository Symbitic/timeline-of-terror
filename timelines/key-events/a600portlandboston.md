9/11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz Alomari's flight from Portland to Boston takes off. [Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10/4/2001] Their plane, Colgan Air Flight 5930, is a 19-seat Beechcraft 1900. [Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2001][1]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 3][2]] Fellow passengers Vincent Meisner and Roger Quirion will later say Atta and Alomari board separately, keep quiet, and do not draw attention to themselves. [[Chicago Sun-Times, 9/16/2001][3]; [Washington Post, 9/16/2001][4]] Quirion, says: "They struck me as business travelers. They were sitting down, talking, seems like they were going over some paperwork." [[CBS News, 10/12/2001][5]]
