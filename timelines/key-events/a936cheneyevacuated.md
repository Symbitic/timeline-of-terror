Vice President Dick Cheney is taken by the Secret Service from his office to an underground tunnel leading to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) below the White House around this time, according to some accounts, including the 9/11 Commission Report, although other accounts will suggest he was evacuated from his office about half an hour earlier. [[United States Secret Service, 11/17/2001][1]; [Newsweek, 12/30/2001][2]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 39-40][3]; [Hayes, 2007, pp. 333, 335][4]] Cheney, who is in his office in the West Wing of the White House, is aware of the two plane crashes in New York and realizes this is a terrorist attack. He is now "watching developments on the television," he will later recall, and starting "to get organized to figure out what to do." [[Meet the Press, 9/16/2001][5]; [Hayes, 2007, pp. 330-331][4]] The Secret Service was informed that an unidentified aircraft was heading toward the White House at around 9:33 a.m. (see [(9:33 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a933dullescontacts) and [(9:33 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a933reagancalls)). Concern about this aircraft prompted it to order the evacuation of Cheney "just before 9:36," according to the 9/11 Commission Report (see [(9:35 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a935immediateevacuation)). [[Federal Aviation Administration, 9/17/2001][6]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 39][3]]

**Armed Agents Enter Cheney's Office** - Four or five Secret Service agents carrying submachine guns therefore enter Cheney's office, according to Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman. One of them, Special Agent James Scott, pushes through the group of government officials who are gathered around Cheney (see [(Shortly After 9:03 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903cheneysoffice)) and tells the vice president, "Sir, we need to move you—now." Cheney nods, indicating that he will respond to the agent in a moment, and then turns to say something to another person. But Scott brings down the flat of his hand sharply on Cheney's desk and commands, "Now!" [[Gellman, 2008, pp. 114-115][7]]

**Cheney Propelled out of His Office** - Scott then puts his hand on Cheney's shoulder, grabs the vice president by the back of his belt, and moves him out the door. [[Hayes, 2007, pp. 333][4]] Cheney will comment that Secret Service agents "practice this, I'm sure, because… whether you wanted to move or not, you're going. They don't exactly pick you up and carry you. It's more like they propel you forward." [[White House, 11/19/2001][8]] As the Secret Service agents take Cheney through his outer office, the vice president manages to grab the latest issue of The Economist off a table. "I'm always carrying something in case I get hung up someplace," he will explain. "I've got to have something to read." [[Newsweek, 12/30/2001][2]; [Hayes, 2007, pp. 333][4]] Carrying the magazine but nothing more, Cheney is hurried down the hallway, past the Oval Office, and down into the basement of the White House. [[White House, 11/19/2001][8]]

**Other Officials Left in Cheney's Office** - The officials who were with Cheney are left in his office. Mary Matalin, one of Cheney's senior advisers, will recall: "[S]peechwriter John McConnell and I were left behind in his office, staring at each other as if to say, 'What are we, chopped liver?' I think I actually said that." [[National Review, 9/8/2011][9]] Cheney will arrive in the underground tunnel leading to the PEOC about a minute after he leaves his office (see [(9:37 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a937cheneyintunnel)). There he will learn that the Pentagon has been hit and talk over the phone with the president (see [(9:45 a.m.-9:56 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a937stayaway)) before heading into the PEOC (see [(9:58 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a958cheneysenterpeoc)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 40][3]; [Hayes, 2007, pp. 335-336][4]] However, according to some accounts, Cheney was evacuated from his office a significant time earlier on, around 9:03 a.m., when the second plane crashed in New York (see [(Shortly After 9:03 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a910tobunker)). [[New York Times, 9/13/2001][10]; [Daily Telegraph, 12/16/2001][11]; [ABC News, 9/14/2002][12]; [Clarke, 2004, pp. 1-2][13]]
