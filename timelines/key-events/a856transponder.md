Flight 77's transponder is turned off, meaning that the aircraft's speed, altitude, and flight information are no longer visible on radar displays at the FAA's Indianapolis Center. [[Federal Aviation Administration, 9/17/2001][1]; [National Transportation Safety Board, 2/19/2002][2]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 9][3]] The Indianapolis Center air traffic controller in charge of Flight 77 watched the plane go off course and head southwest before its data disappeared from his radar screen. He looks for primary radar signals along the aircraft's projected flight path as well as in the airspace where it had started to turn, but cannot find it. [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][4]] He tries contacting the plane repeatedly, saying "American 77, Indy," and: "American 77, Indy, radio check. How do you read?" But there is no response. [[New York Times, 10/16/2001][5]; [New York Times, 10/16/2001][6]]

**NEADS Not Contacted** - US News and World Report will later comment, "[E]xperts say that an airliner making a 180-degree turn followed by a transponder turnoff should have been a red flag to controllers." It will quote Robert Cauble, a 20-year veteran of Navy air traffic control, who says: "The fact that the transponder went off, they should have picked up on that immediately. Everyone should have been on alert about what was going on." [[US News and World Report, 10/8/2001][7]] Yet the Indianapolis Center supposedly does not notify NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS). According to the 9/11 Commission, NEADS will only learn that Flight 77 is missing at 9:34 a.m. (see [9:34 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a934flightmissing)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 26-27][3]]

**Controller Thinks Plane Suffered Mechanical Failure** - While several air traffic control centers were reportedly informed of the Flight 11 hijacking as early as 8:25 a.m. (see [8:25 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a825othercenters)), according to the 9/11 Commission, the controller handling Flight 77 does not realize other aircraft have been hijacked, and he is unaware of the situation in New York. He mistakenly assumes Flight 77 has experienced an electrical or mechanical failure. [[Guardian, 10/17/2001][8]; [9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][4]] After he informs other Indianapolis Center personnel of the developing situation, they will clear all other aircraft from the plane's westerly route so their safety will not be affected if Flight 77 is still flying along its original path but unable to be heard. [[Freni, 2003, pp. 29][9]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 460][3]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 30](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=484625)]

**Airline and Possibly Pentagon Learn of Flight 77 Problems** - While NEADS is not alerted about the errant aircraft, a controller at the Indianapolis Center will contact American Airlines at 8:58 to inform it that contact has been lost with Flight 77 (see [8:58 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a900americanheadquarters)). [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 30][10]] And an article in the New York Times will indicate that the Pentagon's National Military Command Center (NMCC) promptly becomes aware of the problems with Flight 77 (see [(Shortly After 8:51 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a856nmccurgentlytalking)).
