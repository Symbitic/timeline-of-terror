The FAA's Boston Center calls NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) in Rome, NY, to alert it to the suspected hijacking of Flight 11. According to the 9/11 Commission, this is "the first notification received by the military "at any level" that American 11 had been hijacked." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 20][1]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 13][2]] The call is made by Joseph Cooper, an air traffic controller at the Boston Center, and answered by Jeremy Powell, a technical sergeant on the NEADS operations floor. [[Vanity Fair, 8/1/2006][3]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 25][4]] Beginning the call, Cooper says: "Hi. Boston Center TMU [traffic management unit], we have a problem here. We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York, and we need you guys to, we need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there, help us out." Powell replies, "Is this real-world or exercise?" Cooper answers, "No, this is not an exercise, not a test." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 20][1]] Shortly into the call, Powell passes the phone on to Lieutenant Colonel Dawne Deskins (see [(8:38 a.m.) September 11, 2001]). Deskins identifies herself to Cooper, and he tells her, "We have a hijacked aircraft and I need you to get some sort of fighters out here to help us out." [[Newhouse News Service, 1/25/2002][5]; [ABC News, 9/11/2002]; [Bamford, 2004, pp. 8][6]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 26][4]]

**Military Claims Call Goes against Procedure** - The 1st Air Force's official history of the response to the 9/11 attacks will later suggest that Boston Center is not following normal procedures when it makes this call to NEADS. It states: "If normal procedures had taken place Powell probably wouldn't have taken that phone call. Normally, the FAA would have contacted officials at the Pentagon's National Military Command Center who would have contacted the North American Aerospace Defense Command. The secretary of defense would have had to approve the use of military assets to assist in a hijacking, always considered a law enforcement issue." The only explanation it gives for this departure from protocol is that "nothing was normal on Sept. 11, 2001, and many say the traditional chain of command went by the wayside to get the job done." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 51][7]]

**Accounts Conflict over Time of Call** - There will be some conflict between different accounts, as to when this vital call from Boston Center to NEADS occurs. An ABC News documentary will indicate it is made as early as 8:31 a.m. [[ABC News, 9/11/2002]] Another ABC News report will state, "Shortly after 8:30 a.m., behind the scenes, word of a possible hijacking [reaches] various stations of NORAD." [[ABC News, 9/14/2002][8]] NEADS logs indicate the call occurs at 8:40 a.m., and NORAD will report this as the time of the call in a press release on September 18, 2001. [Federal Aviation Administration, 9/17/2001][9]; [North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][10]] The 8:40 time will be widely reported in the media prior to the 9/11 Commission's 2004 report. [[Associated Press, 8/21/2002][11]; [BBC, 9/1/2002][12]; [Newsday, 9/10/2002]; [CNN, 9/11/2002][13]] But tape recordings of the NEADS operations floor that are referred to in the 9/11 Commission Report place the call at 8:37 and 52 seconds. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 20][1]; [Vanity Fair, 8/1/2006][14]] If the 8:37 a.m. time is correct, this would mean that air traffic controllers have failed to successfully notify the military until approximately 12 minutes after they became certain that Flight 11 had been hijacked (see [(8:25 a.m.) September 11, 2001]), 16 minutes after Flight 11's transponder signal was lost (see [(Between 8:13 a.m. and 8:21 a.m.) September 11, 2001]), and 24 minutes after the plane's pilots made their last radio contact (see [8:13 a.m. September 11, 2001]). [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][15]] At 8:34, the Boston Center tried contacting the military through the FAA's Cape Cod facility, which is located on Otis Air National Guard Base, but was told that it needed to call NEADS (see [8:34 a.m. September 11, 2001]). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 20][1]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 22][4]]
