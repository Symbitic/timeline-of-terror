Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld heads for the crash site immediately after the Pentagon is hit. At the time of the attack, Rumsfeld is in his office proceeding with his regularly scheduled CIA briefing, despite being aware of the two attacks on the World Trade Center earlier on. Waiting outside his door is Officer Aubrey Davis of the Pentagon police, who is assigned to the defense secretary's personal bodyguard and has come of his own initiative to move Rumsfeld to a better-protected location. According to Davis, there is "an incredibly loud 'boom,'" as the Pentagon is struck. Just 15 or 20 seconds later, Rumsfeld walks out of his door looking composed, having already put on the jacket he normally discards when in his office. Davis informs him there is a report of an airplane hitting a section of the Pentagon known as the Mall. Rumsfeld sets off without saying anything or informing any of his command staff where he is going, and heads swiftly toward the Mall. Davis accompanies him, as does Rumsfeld's other security guard Gilbert Oldach, his communications officer, and the deputy director of security for the secretary's office. Finding no sign of damage at the Mall, Davis tells Rumsfeld, "[N]ow we're hearing it's by the heliport," which is along the next side of the building. Despite Davis's protests that he should head back, Rumsfeld continues onward, and they go outside near where the crash occurred. [[Cockburn, 2007, pp. 1-2][1]; [Goldberg et al., 2007, pp. 130][2]; [Democracy Now!, 3/7/2007][3]] The Pentagon was hit on the opposite site of the huge building to Rumsfeld's office. [[Reuters, 9/11/2001][4]] Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke will say that Rumsfeld is "one of the first people" to arrive at the crash scene. [[KYW Radio 1060 (Philadelphia), 9/15/2001][5]] He spends a brief time there (see [Between 9:38 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. September 11, 2001](#a937rumsfeldhelp)), before returning to the building by about 10:00 a.m., according to his own account (see [(10:00 a.m.-10:30 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1000rumsfeldcall)). [[9/11 Commission, 3/23/2004][6]] Rumsfeld will later justify his actions following the attack, saying, "I was going, which seemed to me perfectly logically, towards the scene of the accident to see what could be done and what had happened." [[US Department of Defense, 8/12/2002][7]] As journalist Andrew Cockburn will point out, though, "[T]he country was under attack and yet the secretary of defense disappears for 20 minutes." [[C-SPAN, 2/25/2007][8]] John Jester, the chief of the Defense Protective Service, which guards the Pentagon, will criticize Rumsfeld for heading to the crash scene at this time. He will say: "One of my officers tried to stop him and he just brushed him off. I told [Rumsfeld's] staff that he should not have done that. He is in the national command authority; he should not have gone to the scene." [[Historical Office, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 10/19/2001][9]] The numerous reports of Rumsfeld going outside to the crash scene are apparently contradicted by counterterrorism "tsar" Richard Clarke. In his 2004 book  Against All Enemies, Clarke will give the impression that Rumsfeld never leaves a video conference for very long after the Pentagon is hit, except to move from one secure teleconferencing studio to another elsewhere in the Pentagon. [[Clarke, 2004, pp. 7-9][10]] However, video footage confirms that Rumsfeld does indeed go to the crash site. [[CNN, 8/17/2002][11]]
