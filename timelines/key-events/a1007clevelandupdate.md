The military liaison at the FAA's Cleveland Center calls NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) and alerts it to the hijacked Flight 93. According to the 9/11 Commission, this is the first notification NEADS receives about Flight 93, but it comes too late, since the plane has already crashed (see [(10:06 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1006flight93crash)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 30][1]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 46][2]]

**'Bomb on Board' Flight 93** - At 10:05 a.m., the military liaison at the Cleveland Center, who is unaware that Flight 93 has just crashed, calls NEADS to inform it that Flight 93 is heading toward Washington, DC. Even though communicating with NEADS is not one of his responsibilities, he wants to make sure it is in the loop. [[Spencer, 2008, pp. 224][3]] At NEADS, the call is answered by Tech Sergeant Shelley Watson. Shortly into the call, at 10:07, the military liaison tells her: "We got a United 93 out here. Are you aware of that?" He continues, "That has a bomb on board." Watson asks: "A bomb on board? And this is confirmed? You have a mode three [beacon code], sir?" The military liaison replies, "No, we lost his transponder" (see [(9:40 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a940stilltracked)). The news about Flight 93 is shouted out to Major Kevin Nasypany, the NEADS mission crew commander. Nasypany responds: "Gimme the call sign. Gimme the whole nine yards.… Let's get some info, real quick. They got a bomb?" 

**Liaison Wants Fighters Sent toward Flight 93** - The military liaison continues, asking Watson if NEADS scrambled fighter jets in response to Delta 1989, an aircraft that was mistakenly reported as having been hijacked (see [(9:28 a.m.-9:33 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a930deltamistake) and [9:39 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a941bostoncontacts)). Watson replies: "We did. Out of Selfridge and Toledo" (see [(9:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a955neadscallsselfridge) and [10:01 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1000toledoscramble)), and says these jets are airborne. When the military liaison asks if the fighters can be directed to where Flight 93 is, Watson asks him if the Cleveland Center has latitude and longitude coordinates for this aircraft. The military liaison replies that he has not got this information available right now. All he knows is that Flight 93 has "got a confirmed bomb on board… and right now, his last known position was in the Westmoreland area.… Which is… in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area." [[North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/11/2001][4]; [Vanity Fair, 8/1/2006][5]]

**NEADS Searches on Radar** - The news of a bomb on board Flight 93 spreads quickly at NEADS, and personnel there search for the aircraft's primary return on their radar screens. But because the plane has already crashed, they will be unable to locate it. NEADS will only learn that Flight 93 has crashed at 10:15 a.m., during a call with the FAA's Washington Center (see [10:15 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1015neadslearns)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 30-31][1]]

**FAA Failed to Notify Military Earlier** - The Cleveland Center's notification to NEADS about Flight 93 comes 39 minutes after the plane was hijacked (see [(9:28 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a928takeover)) and 33 minutes after FAA headquarters was alerted to the hijacking (see [9:34 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a934heaquarterstold)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 11, 28][1]] At the time NEADS is alerted to Flight 93, NORAD is similarly uninformed about this aircraft, according to the 9/11 Commission. The Commission will state, "At 10:07, its representative on the air threat conference call stated that NORAD had 'no indication of a hijack heading to DC at this time.'" According to the Commission, the National Military Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon learned about the Flight 93 hijacking slightly earlier on, at 10:03 a.m. (see [10:03 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1003nmcclearns)). However, the NMCC was notified by the White House, not the FAA. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 42][1]] A former senior FAA executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, will later try to explain why it takes the FAA so long to alert NEADS to Flight 93. He will say, "Our whole procedures prior to 9/11 were that you turned everything [regarding a hijacking] over to the FBI." [[Vanity Fair, 8/1/2006][5]] Yet military instructions contradict this, stating, "In the event of a hijacking, the NMCC will be notified by the most expeditious means by the FAA." [[US Department of Defense, 7/31/1997][6]; [US Department of Defense, 6/1/2001][7]]

**NORAD Commanders Claim Earlier Awareness of Flight 93** - Two senior NORAD officials will contradict the 9/11 Commission's conclusion, and claim they were aware of Flight 93 well before it crashed (see [Shortly Before 9:36 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a936noradmonitoring) and [(9:36 a.m.-10:06 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a936trackingflight)). [[Filson, 2003, pp. 68, 71-73][8]] Colonel Robert Marr, the NEADS battle commander, will tell the Commission that, while the flight was still airborne, "his focus was on UAL 93, which was circling over Chicago," and he "distinctly remembers watching the flight UAL 93 come west, and turn over Cleveland." [[9/11 Commission, 10/27/2003][9]; [9/11 Commission, 1/23/2004][10]] Major General Larry Arnold, the commander of the Continental US NORAD Region, will recall, "[W]e watched the [Flight] 93 track as it meandered around the Ohio-Pennsylvania area and started to turn south toward DC." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 71][8]]
