President Bush enters the second-grade classroom of teacher Sandra Kay Daniels at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, where he is going to listen to the children reading. [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 43][1]; [Associated Press, 8/25/2002][2]] Bush is scheduled to observe a series of reading drills in the class and the demonstration is set to end at 9:15 a.m. [[US President, 9/2001][3]] He arrived at the school shortly before 9:00 a.m. (see [(8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a855busharrives)). [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 41][1]] Since then, he has been told that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center (see [(8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a855loewer) and [(Shortly After 8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a855bushfirsttold)) and that the plane involved was a commercial airliner (see [(Shortly Before 9:00 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a900riceinforms)).

**Bush Enters the Classroom Two Minutes Late** - After taking a call from National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Bush enters Daniels' classroom for the reading demonstration two minutes later than planned, at 9:02 a.m. [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 42-43][1]; [Washington Times, 10/7/2002][7]] About 60 people are in the room, including 16 second graders and Daniels, their teacher. [[Sarasota Magazine, 11/2001][8]; [South Florida Sun-Sentinel, 9/11/2011][9]] Reporters who are traveling with the president and members of the local media are assembled at the back of the room. [[Associated Press, 8/25/2002][2]] Secret Service agents are lying in the trusses above the room. [[Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 9/10/2002][10]]

**Bush Is Introduced to the Class** - Gwendolyn Tosé-Rigell, the school principal, accompanies Bush into the room. She says hello to the children and then tells them, "Would you please stand and recognize the president of the United States—President Bush." After saying, "Good morning," Bush introduces the children to Secretary of Education Rod Paige and Florida Lieutenant Governor Frank Brogan, who come in behind him and then take their positions at the side of the room. Bush tells the children, "Good to meet you all." Tosé-Rigell then introduces the president to Daniels. He goes over to the teacher and shakes her hand. After instructing the children to sit down, he tells the class: "It's really exciting for me to be here. I want to thank Ms. Daniels for being a teacher. I want to thank Gwen for being a principal. And I want to thank you all for practicing reading so much. It's really important." Finally, a minute after he entered the classroom, Daniels and the children begin their reading demonstration. 

**Bush Still Thinks the Crash at the WTC Was an Accident** - As he watches the children reading, Bush will start thinking about the statement he will need to make about the crash at the WTC, although he is not particularly troubled about the incident at the moment. "I was concentrating on the [reading] program at this point, thinking about what I was going to say," he will later recall. He will add: "Obviously, I felt [the crash] was an accident. I was concerned about it, but there were no alarm bells." [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 43-49][1]; [Washington Times, 10/7/2002][7]] A few minutes after the reading demonstration begins, Andrew Card, Bush's chief of staff, will enter the room, and whisper to the president that a second plane has crashed into the WTC and America is under attack (see [(9:07 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a906cardtellsbush)), but despite hearing this devastating news, Bush will stay in the room and listen to the rest of the demonstration (see [(9:08 a.m.-9:13 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a906petgoat)). [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 83-91][1]; [Washington Times, 10/7/2002][7]; [Wall Street Journal, 3/22/2004][11]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 38-39][12]]
