In a phone call with Vice President Dick Cheney, President Bush authorizes the military to shoot down hostile aircraft. Minutes earlier, in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) below the White House, a military aide had asked Cheney for the authority to engage what appeared to be an inbound aircraft, and Cheney had promptly given it (see [(Between 10:10 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1000shootdown)). During a subsequent quiet moment, deputy White House chief of staff Josh Bolten, who is also in the PEOC, suggested to Cheney that he contact the president to confirm the engage order. Therefore at 10:18 a.m., according to White House logs, Cheney calls Bush, who is on board Air Force One, and speaks with him for two minutes. White House press secretary Ari Fleischer notes that at 10:20 a.m., Bush informs him that he has authorized the shootdown of aircraft, if necessary. According to the 9/11 Commission, "Fleischer's 10:20 note is the first mention of shootdown authority." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 41 and 465][1]] Bush's senior adviser Karl Rove, who is also on Air Force One, gives a similar account, later telling NBC News that "at about 10:20," Bush goes from his office into the private cabin in front of it, "and took a phone call, and came back in and said that he had talked to the vice president and to the secretary of defense and gave the authorization that [the] military could shoot down any planes not under control of their crews that were gearing critical targets." [[MSNBC, 9/11/2002][2]] But other accounts indicate the president gives the shootdown authorization earlier than this. Bush and Cheney will claim that Bush gives the authorization during a call estimated to occur between about 10:00 and 10:15 (see [(Between 10:00 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1000bushcheneyconfer)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 40][1]] Similarly, according to journalists Bob Woodward and Bill Sammon, Bush gives it in a call with Cheney soon after 9:56, when Air Force One takes off (see [(Shortly After 9:56 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a956bushcheneyphone)). [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 102][3]; [Woodward, 2002, pp. 17-18][4]; [Washington Post, 1/27/2002][5]] Counterterrorism "tsar" Richard Clarke says it is given even earlier. He states that, at some point between about 9:38 and 9:56, he is instructed to tell the Pentagon it has authorization from the president to shoot down hostile aircraft (see [(9:38 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a938clarkeshootdown) and [(Between 9:45 a.m. and 9:56 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a945shootdownorder)).
