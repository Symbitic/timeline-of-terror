Two F-15 fighter jets are scrambled from Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, which is 153 miles from New York City. The fighters are launched in response to the hijacked Flight 11, but this plane is already crashing into the World Trade Center at this time (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001][9]). [[Washington Post, 9/15/2001][1]; [CNN, 9/17/2001][2]; [North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][3]; [9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][4]]

**Delay** - The FAA's Boston Center alerted NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) to the hijacking of Flight 11 and requested that fighter jets be scrambled at just before 8:38 a.m. (see [(8:37 a.m.) September 11, 2001][11]), but the mission crew commander at NEADS only instructed the leader of his weapons team to launch the Otis fighters at 8:45 a.m. [[Vanity Fair, 8/1/2006][5]]

**Otis Aircraft Head to Runway** - As soon as the pilots at Otis Air Base are strapped into their aircraft, the green light directing them to launch goes on. They start their engines and taxi out of the hangar to the nearest runway. One of the pilots, Lt. Col. Timothy Duffy, radios his command post for guidance, asking, "Do you have words?" The response he gets is, "Possible hijack, American Flight 11, 737, flight level 290 [29,000 feet], over JFK [International Airport in New York City]." (This flight information is partly incorrect, since American 11 is a 767, not a 737.) According to the Cape Cod Times, the jets will be up in the air before their radar kicks in. [[Cape Cod Times, 8/21/2002][6]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 42][7]] The Otis pilots have already been preparing for the scramble order to come since learning of the hijacking from the FAA's Cape Cod facility, some time shortly after 8:34 a.m.. [[BBC, 9/1/2002][8]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 27-30][7]] Their jets are reportedly not airborne until seven minutes after being scrambled, at 8:53 a.m. and there will be conflicting accounts of what their original destination is (see [8:53 a.m.-9:05 a.m. September 11, 2001][10]).
