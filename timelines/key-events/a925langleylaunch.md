The three F-16 fighter jets ordered to scramble from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia (see [9:24 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a924ordertoscramble)) take off and, radar data will show, are airborne by 9:30 a.m. [[North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][1]; [Christian Science Monitor, 4/16/2002][2]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 27][3]]

**Delayed during Launch** - Major Dean Eckmann will recall that, after receiving the scramble order, he and the two other pilots have "a pretty quick response time. I believe it was four to five minutes we were airborne from that point." [[BBC, 9/1/2002][4]] According to the 1st Air Force's book about 9/11, the three fighters are "given highest priority over all other air traffic at Langley Air Force Base" as they are launching. [[Filson, 2003, pp. 63][5]] But, according to author Lynn Spencer, in spite of this, the jets are delayed. As Eckmann is approaching the runway, he calls the control tower for clearance to take off, but the tower controller tells him, "Hold for an air traffic delay." Air traffic controllers at the FAA's Washington Center "have not had time to clear airliners out of the way for the northerly heading. Dozens of aircraft at various altitudes fill the jets' route." After having to wait two minutes, Eckmann complains: "We're an active air scramble. We need to go now!" Finally, the tower controller tells him, "Roger, Quit flight is cleared for takeoff, 090 for 60," meaning the fighters are to fly due east for 60 miles (see [(9:30 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a930langleytower)). 

**Taking Off** - The three jets launch 15 seconds apart, with Eckmann in front and the two other jets following. [[Spencer, 2008, pp. 143-144][6]] Pilot Craig Borgstrom will later recall, "[W]e took off, the three of us, and basically the formation we always brief on alert, we'll stay in a two- to three-mile trail from the guy in front." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 63][5]] According to the BBC, the pilots get a signal over their planes' transponders, indicating an emergency wartime situation. [[BBC, 9/1/2002][4]]

**Could Reach Washington before Pentagon Attack** - F-16s have a maximum speed of 1,500 mph at high altitude, or 915 mph at sea level, so the three fighters could plausibly travel the 130 miles from Langley Air Force Base to Washington in just minutes. [[Chant, 1987, pp. 404][6]; [Associated Press, 6/16/2000][7]; [USA Today, 9/16/2001][8]; [US Air Force, 10/2007][9]] Major General Larry Arnold, the commanding general of NORAD's Continental US Region, will tell the 9/11 Commission, "I think if those aircraft had gotten airborne immediately, if we were operating under something other than peacetime rules, where they could have turned immediately toward Washington, DC, and gone into burner, it is physically possible that they could have gotten over Washington" before 9:37, when the Pentagon is hit. [[9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][10]] Yet according to the 9/11 Commission, the jets are redirected east over the Atlantic Ocean and will be 150 miles from the Pentagon when it is hit (see [9:30 a.m.-9:37 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a930goeast)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 27][3]]

**Conflicting Times** - Some early news reports after 9/11 will say the Langley jets take off at the later time of 9:35 a.m. [[Washington Post, 9/12/2001][11]; [CNN, 9/14/2001][12]; [Washington Post, 9/15/2001][13]; [CNN, 9/17/2001][14]] But according to Colonel Alan Scott, the former vice commander of the Continental US NORAD Region, though the jets are airborne at 9:30, the report of this does not come down until 9:35, so this fact may account for the conflicting times. [[9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][10]]
