An anonymous phone call is received at the White House in which the caller says Air Force One, the president's plane, will be the next terrorist target and uses code words indicating they have inside information about government procedures. [[Cheney, 9/11/2001][1]; [New York Times, 9/13/2001][2]; [Woodward, 2002, pp. 18][3]] Air Force One is currently flying toward Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, with President Bush on board (see [(10:20 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1020destinationbarksdale)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 325][4]] The White House receives a call from an anonymous individual, warning that the next target of the terrorist attacks will be Air Force One. The caller refers to the plane as "Angel." [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 106-107][5]; [Woodward, 2002, pp. 18][3]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 554][4]; [Darling, 2010, pp. 60-61][6]] "Angel" is the Secret Service's code name for Air Force One. [[Williams, 2004, pp. 81][7]; [CBS News, 11/25/2009][8]] An unnamed "high White House official" will later say the use of "American code words" shows the caller has "knowledge of procedures that made the threat credible." [[New York Times, 9/13/2001][9]]

**Government Officials Told about Threat** - News of the threatening call is promptly passed on to government officials in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC)—a bunker below the White House—and reported on the Pentagon's air threat conference call. [[US Department of Defense, 9/11/2001][10]; [Newsweek, 12/30/2001][11]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 554][4]; [Darling, 2010, pp. 60-61][6]] Vice President Dick Cheney, who is in the PEOC, will comment that the news "reinforced the notion here… that the government has been targeted and that we need to be extra careful about making certain we protected the continuity of government, secured the president, secured the presidency." [[White House, 11/19/2001][12]] According to Major Robert Darling of the White House Military Office, who is also in the PEOC, "The talk among the principals in the room quickly determined that the use of a code word implied that the threat to Air Force One and the president could well be from someone with access to [the president's] inner circle—possibly someone who was near the president at that very moment." [[Darling, 2010, pp. 61][6]]

**Accounts Conflict over Who Receives Call** - It is unclear who at the White House answers the call in which the threat against Air Force One is made. The call is received by the White House switchboard, according to some accounts. [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 106][5]; [Fleischer, 2005, pp. 141-142][13]] Other accounts will indicate it is received by the White House Situation Room. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 554][4]; [Darling, 2010, pp. 60-61][6]] Eric Edelman, a member of Cheney's staff who is in the PEOC, will say the call is received by the Secret Service. [[White House, 10/25/2001][14]] But two Secret Service agents who are on duty today will deny "that their agency played any role in receiving or passing on a threat to the presidential jet," according to the Wall Street Journal. [[Wall Street Journal, 3/22/2004][15]] However, a Secret Service pager message will be sent at 10:32 a.m., which states that the "JOC"—the Secret Service Joint Operations Center at the White House—has received an "anonymous call" reporting that "Angel is [a] target." [[CBS News, 11/25/2009][8]]

**Military Officer Passes on Details of Threat** - Officials in the PEOC reportedly learn about the threat to Air Force One from a military officer working in the center. Although Cheney will say the threat "came through the Secret Service," he will say later this year that he is unsure who passed the details of it to those in the PEOC. [[Meet the Press, 9/16/2001][16]; [White House, 11/19/2001][12]] An official in Cheney's office will say in 2004 that Cheney was informed of the threat by "a uniformed military person" manning the PEOC, although Cheney and his staff are unaware who that individual was. [[Wall Street Journal, 3/22/2004][15]] National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice will say that those in the PEOC are told about the threat by a "communicator," meaning one of the military officers who works in the PEOC, and is responsible for "establishing phone lines and video lines, and staying in touch with the National Military Command Center" at the Pentagon. [[White House, 11/1/2001][17]] The military officer Rice is referring to may be Darling. Darling will recall that he answers a call from the White House Situation Room about the threat to Air Force One and then passes on the information he receives to Rice, telling her, "Ma'am, the [Situation Room] reports that they have a credible source in the Sarasota, Florida, area that claims Angel is the next target." Rice immediately passes on the news to Cheney, according to Darling. [[Darling, 2010, pp. 60-61][6]] Cheney will subsequently call Bush and tell him about the threat (see [(10:32 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1032angelthreat)). [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 106-107][5]; [CBS News, 9/11/2002][18]]

**Reason for 'Bogus' Threat Unclear** - The threat will be determined to be "almost surely bogus," according to Newsweek. [[Newsweek, 12/30/2001][11]] The Secret Service's intelligence division tracked down the origin of this threat," the 9/11 Commission Report will state, "and, during the day, determined that it had originated in a misunderstanding by a watch officer in the White House Situation Room." Although the 9/11 Commission will say it found the intelligence division's "witnesses on this point to be credible," Deborah Loewer, the director of the White House Situation Room, will dispute this account. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 554][4]] By the end of 2001, White House officials will say they still do not know where the threat came from. [[Newsweek, 12/30/2001][11]] Darling will write in 2010, "To this day, it has never been determined why either the 'credible source' or Situation Room personnel used that code word [i.e. 'Angel'] in their report to the PEOC." [[Darling, 2010, pp. 62][6]] "The best we can tell," Rice will say, is that "there was a call that talked about events—something happening to the president on the ground in Florida. And that somehow got interpreted as Air Force One." She will say that the fact the caller knew the code name for Air Force One is "why we still continue to suspect it wasn't a crank call." [[White House, 11/1/2001][17]] However, former Secret Service officials will say the code name wasn't an official secret, but instead "a radio shorthand designation that had been made public well before 2001." [[Wall Street Journal, 3/22/2004][15]]
