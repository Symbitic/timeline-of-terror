Still inside Booker Elementary School, President Bush gives a brief speech in front of about 200 students, teachers and reporters. [[Washington Times, 10/8/2002][1]] He says: "Today we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country." [[White House, 9/11/2001][2]] The talk occurs at exactly the time and place stated in his publicly announced advance scheduleâ€”making Bush a possible terrorist target.
