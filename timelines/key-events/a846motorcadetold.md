White House officials and reporters who are traveling with President Bush in Florida learn that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center while they are being driven to the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, but Bush is not notified about the crash at this time. [[White House, 8/12/2002][1]; [St. Petersburg Times, 7/4/2004][2]; [Rochester Review, 9/2004][3]] A number of senior officials who are together in a van learn about the crash as their vehicle is pulling into the school's driveway. Those in the van include White House press secretary Ari Fleischer; White House communications director Dan Bartlett; Bush's senior adviser, Karl Rove; Bush's CIA briefer, Mike Morell; and White House photographer Eric Draper.

**Press Secretary Is Contacted by an Assistant** - Fleischer is alerted to the crash by Brian Bravo, an assistant in the White House press office. Bravo learned what happened when he was called by a friend in New York who had seen Flight 11 hitting the WTC, at 8:46 a.m. (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846flight11hits)), and then saw the television coverage of the incident. In response, he sent a pager message to Fleischer, simply stating, "A plane has hit the World Trade Center." [[White House, 8/8/2002][6]; [Fleischer, 2005, pp. 138][4]; [Politico Magazine, 9/9/2016][7]] After seeing the message, Fleischer exclaims: "Oh, my God! I don't believe it! A plane just hit the World Trade Center." [[Albuquerque Tribune, 9/10/2002][8]; [Bamford, 2004, pp. 17][9]] He turns to Morell and asks the CIA officer if he knows anything about the incident. Morell says no and that he will make some calls to try and find out more. He will call the CIA's operations center to see what people there know (see [Shortly Before 9:00 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a900morellcalls)). [[Studies in Intelligence, 9/2006][5]; [Morell and Harlow, 2015, pp. 47-48][10]]

**Other Officials Receive Calls from the White House** - Around the time Fleischer is alerted to the crash, Rove is called from the White House by his assistant, Susan Ralston, who tells him what happened at the WTC (see [(8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a855ralstoncallsrove)). [[New Yorker, 9/25/2001][11]; [Filipinas, 2/2004][12]] And Bartlett receives a call from his assistant at the White House, who tells him: "There's just been an incredible accident or something. A plane has hit the World Trade Center." [[White House, 8/12/2002][1]]

**Military Officers Are Called about the Crash** - In another vehicle in the motorcade, Navy Captain Deborah Loewer, the director of the White House Situation Room, receives a call from Rob Hargis, the senior duty officer in the Situation Room, alerting her to the crash. [[Dayton Daily News, 8/17/2003][13]; [McClatchy Newspapers, 8/29/2011][14]; [Priess, 2016, pp. 239-240][15]] Meanwhile, as his vehicle is arriving at the school, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Herman, a senior presidential communications officer assigned to the White House, is contacted by his operations center, and notified that a plane has struck one of the Twin Towers and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice wants to talk on the phone with the president. [[Marist Magazine, 10/2002][16]]

**Members of the Press Are Alerted to the Crash** - Members of the press traveling in the motorcade also learn about the crash during the journey to the school. Reporter Richard Keil is told what happened when he talks on the phone with a friend who has seen the coverage of the incident on television. Keil then passes on the news to the other reporters and photographers in the press van. And Kia Baskerville, a CBS News White House producer, receives a call on her cell phone from a producer who tells her about the crash. [[CBS News, 8/19/2002](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-longest-day-19-08-2002/); [Rochester Review, 9/2004][4]]

**President Is Not Told about the Crash** - And yet, while these people are alerted to the crash, Bush reportedly is not called about it at this time and he will only be told what has happened after he arrives at the school (see [(8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a855loewer) and [(Shortly After 8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a855bushfirsttold)). [[St. Petersburg Times, 7/4/2004][2]; [Rove, 2010, pp. 249-250][17]; [Priess, 2016, pp. 240][15]] This is despite the fact that his limousine is "bristling with communications gear," according to the Los Angeles Times. [[Los Angeles Times, 1/24/2001][18]] "In the presidential limo, the communications system is almost duplicative of the White House," author Philip Melanson will note. [[St. Petersburg Times, 7/4/2004][2]] "Yet despite having a secure STU-III phone next to himâ€¦ and an entire national security staff at the White House," author James Bamford will comment, "it appears that the president of the United States knew less than tens of millions of other people in every part of the country who were watching the attack as it unfolded." [[Bamford, 2004, pp. 17][9]] "It mystifies me why they didn't call the president," Robert Plunket, a reporter who is waiting for the president at the school, will remark. "He's totally surrounded by state-of-the-art communications equipment and nobody tells him." [[St. Petersburg Times, 7/4/2004][2]]
