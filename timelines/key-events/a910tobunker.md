Vice President Dick Cheney is taken by the Secret Service from his White House office toward the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) below the East Wing of the White House around this time, according to some accounts, although other accounts, including the 9/11 Commission Report, will state that he is evacuated from his office about half an hour later. [[New York Times, 9/13/2001][1]; [Daily Telegraph, 12/16/2001][2]; [ABC News, 9/14/2002][3]; [Clarke, 2004, pp. 1-2][4]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 39-40][13]]
* The Secret Service evacuates Cheney from his office "[j]ust after 9 a.m.," according to ABC News. At this time, "two or three agents came in and told him, 'Sir, you have to come with us.'" [[ABC News, 9/14/2002][3]]
* New York Times columnist William Safire will write, two days after 9/11, that Cheney is evacuated at 9:03 a.m., after he sees Flight 175 crashing into the World Trade Center live on television (see [9:03 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903flight175crashes)). "At that moment," according to Safire, "his Secret Service detail grabbed him and hurried him down to [the] PEOC." [[New York Times, 9/13/2001][1]]
* Britain's Daily Telegraph will report that at about 9:05 a.m., around the time when President Bush is informed of the second plane crash in New York (see [(9:07 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a906cardtellsbush)), "a squad of Secret Service agents stormed into the office of Vice President Dick Cheney," seizes the vice president, and carries him down to the PEOC. [[Daily Telegraph, 12/16/2001][2]]
* White House counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke will indicate that Cheney is evacuated shortly after the second plane hits the WTC. Clarke will write that after he learns of the second attack, he briefly talks to Cheney in the vice president's office (see [(9:05 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a905evacuationignored)). As he leaves the room, he notices Cheney gathering up his papers and then sees eight Secret Service agents in Cheney's outer office, "ready to move to the PEOC." [[Clarke, 2004, pp. 1-2][4]]
* President Bush's personal secretary, Ashley Estes, will recall seeing Secret Service agents running down the hallway, carrying Cheney along, after she watches the second plane hit the WTC on television at 9:03 a.m. [[White House, 8/29/2002][5]]
* Cheney will describe the urgency with which his Secret Service agents move him out of his office, recalling that they "came in and said, 'Sir, we have to leave immediately,' and grabbed me… and they hoisted me up and moved me very rapidly down the hallway, down some stairs, through some doors, and down some more stairs into an underground facility under the White House." [[Meet the Press, 9/16/2001][6]]

**Some Accounts Consistent with Early Evacuation Time** - Some accounts, while not specifically describing Cheney being hurried away from his office by the Secret Service, will be consistent with the vice president being evacuated around the time of the second attack in New York. White House adviser Karl Rove, who is with the president in Florida, will tell NBC News that when Bush tries phoning Cheney at around 9:16 a.m., he is unable to contact him because "the vice president was being… grabbed by a Secret Service agent and moved to the bunker" (see [(9:16 a.m.-9:29 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a916writesspeech)). [[MSNBC, 9/11/2002][7]] And Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta will say that when he arrives at the PEOC, between around 9:20 a.m. and 9:27 a.m., Cheney is already there (see [(Between 9:20 a.m. and 9:27 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a920minetabunker)). [[MSNBC, 9/11/2002][8]; [9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][9]; [Academy of Achievement, 6/3/2006][10]] However, other accounts, including the 9/11 Commission Report, will state that Cheney is evacuated from his office a significant time after the second attack, at around 9:36 a.m. (see [(9:36 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a936cheneyevacuated)).
