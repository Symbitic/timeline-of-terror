At some point after the White House is ordered to evacuate and while Air Force One is preparing to take off in Florida, counterterrorism "tsar" Richard Clarke activates the Continuity of Government (COG) plan. The coordinator for Continuity of Government has joined Clarke in the White House Situation Room. Clarke asks, "How do I activate COG?" Recalling this conversation, he will later comment, "In the exercises we had done, the person playing the president had always given that order." But the coordinator replies, "You tell me to do it." Soon after, Clarke instructs him, "Go." [[Clarke, 2004, pp. 8][1]]

**First Time COG Plan Activated** - The Continuity of Government plan, which dates back to the Reagan administration, had originally prepared to set up a new leadership for the US in the event of a nuclear war. This is apparently the first time it has ever been put into effect. Clarke will recall, "Every federal agency was orderedâ€¦ to activate an alternative command post, an alternative headquarters outside of Washington, DC, and to staff it as soon as possible." Cabinet officers are dispatched around the country, and people in Congress are taken to alternative locations. 

**Clarke Regularly Particiated in COG Exercises** - Since the 1980s, Clarke has in fact been a regular participant in secret COG exercises that rehearsed this plan. [[Washington Post, 4/7/2004][2]; [ABC News, 4/25/2004][3]] Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also participated (see [1981-1992](/timeline/#a81cogexercises)). [[Atlantic Monthly, 3/2004][4]] Kenneth Duberstein, formerly President Reagan's White House chief of staff, who took part in the exercises as well, will recall: "I said to myself, as we proceeded through the day [of 9/11], 'It's working.' All those days of patriotic duty were coming back and they were working." According to ABC News, "If executive branch leaders and large numbers of congressmen had been killed in an attack on the United States, the plan could have gone further, officials suggest, perhaps even with non-elected leaders of the United States taking control and declaring martial law." [[ABC News, 4/25/2004][3]] According to a White House timeline of the events of 9/11, it is in fact Cheney that "orders implementation of Continuity of Government and Continuity of Operations procedures," at 9:55 a.m., although, according to the Washington Post, Cheney only "officially implemented the emergency Continuity of Government orders," rather than activating the plan.
