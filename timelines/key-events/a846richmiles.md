A flight attendant on Flight 175 calls the United Airlines maintenance office in San Francisco and speaks with Marc Policastro, an employee there. The attendant reports that Flight 175 has been hijacked, both of its pilots have been killed, a flight attendant has been stabbed, and the hijackers are probably flying the plane. The line then goes dead. [[Wall Street Journal, 10/15/2001][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 7-8][2]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 21][3]] The call, which lasts 75 seconds, is made using an Airfone in row 31 at the back of the plane. Flight crews on United aircraft are able to contact the maintenance office simply by dialing *349 on an Airfone. [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 90-91][3]; [US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, 7/31/2006][4]] The identity of the attendant making the call is unclear. According to the Wall Street Journal, the caller is "a female flight attendant." [[Wall Street Journal, 10/15/2001][1]] The 9/11 Commission Report, however, refers to them as "a male flight attendant," and one of the Commission's earlier staff statements will specifically name Robert Fangman, who is one of the attendants on Flight 175. [[9/11 Commission, 1/27/2004][5]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 7][2]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 18][3]] A summary of the phone calls made from the four hijacked planes presented at the 2006 Zacarias Moussaoui trial will refer to the caller simply as a "flight attendant," with a question mark signifying their name. [[US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, 7/31/2006][4]] After the call ends, Policastro and also another employee at the maintenance office try contacting Flight 175 using ACARS (an e-mail system that enables personnel on the ground to rapidly communicate with those in the cockpit of an aircraft), but they receive no response to these and subsequent attempts at reaching the flight. According to GTE Airfone records, another successful call will be made from Flight 175 to the maintenance office four minutes after this first one (see [8:56 a.m. September 11, 2001]). However, other evidence indicates only one call is made. Shortly before 9:00 a.m., a supervisor at the maintenance office will call the United Airlines System Operations Control center, just outside Chicago, and inform a manager there of the reported hijacking of Flight 175 (see [Shortly Before 9:00 a.m. September 11, 2001]). The supervisor also calls the airline's security chief. [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 21-22 and 90][3]]
