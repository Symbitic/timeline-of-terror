Numerous reports incorrectly claiming that aircraft have been hijacked are received while the terrorist attacks are taking place and into the afternoon. [[Code One Magazine, 1/2002][1]; [Newhouse News Service, 3/31/2005][2]; [Politico Magazine, 9/9/2016][3]] There are "multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft" during the morning, according to the 9/11 Commission Report. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 28][4]] At around 9:09 a.m., the FAA Command Center reports that 11 aircraft are either not communicating with FAA facilities or flying unexpected routes. [[Aviation Week and Space Technology, 6/3/2002][5]] Major General Larry Arnold, the commander of the Continental United States NORAD Region, will later claim that during the "four-hour ordeal" of the attacks, a total of 21 planes are identified as possible hijackings. [[Filson, 2002][6]; [Code One Magazine, 1/2002][1]; [Filson, 2003, pp. 71][7]] Colonel Robert Marr, the battle commander at NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS), will say, "At one time I was told that across the nation there were some 29 different reports of hijackings." [[Newhouse News Service, 3/31/2005][2]] Secret Service agent Dave Wilkinson, who travels with President Bush on Air Force One after it leaves Sarasota, Florida (see [9:54 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a955takeoff)), will recall that by the time the plane reaches Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, at 2:50 p.m. (see [2:50 p.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a250omaha)), "there were like 15 to 20 planes still unaccounted for" nationwide. "For everything we knew, they were all hijacked," he will say. [[Politico Magazine, 9/9/2016][3]] Officials will claim that these false reports cause considerable confusion. Arnold will recall that particularly during the time between the Pentagon being hit at, 9:37 a.m., and Flight 93 going down, at around 10:03 a.m., "a number of aircraft are being called possibly hijacked.&#x2026; There was a lot of confusion, as you can imagine." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 71-73][7]] He will say: "We were receiving many reports of hijacked aircraft. When we received those calls, we might not know from where the aircraft had departed. We also didn't know the location of the airplane." [[Code One Magazine, 1/2002][1]] Marr will comment: "There were a number of false reports out there. What was valid? What was a guess? We just didn't know." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 73][7]] Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke, who is in the Pentagon during the attacks and for most of the rest of the day, will recall: "There were lots of false signals out there. There were false hijack squawks, and a great part of the challenge was sorting through what was a legitimate threat and what wasn't." [[CNN, 6/17/2004][8]; [Clarke, 2006, pp. 215-231][9]]
