Air Force One takes off from off from Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport in Florida with President Bush on board. [[USA Today, 9/11/2001][1]; [Washington Post, 1/27/2002][2]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 39][3]] The plane takes off without any fighter jets protecting it. "The object seemed to be simply to get the president airborne and out of the way," an administration official will later say. [[Daily Telegraph, 12/16/2001][4]] There are still 3,520 planes in the air over the US. [[USA Today, 8/13/2002][5]] About half of the planes in the Florida region where Bush's plane is are still airborne. [[St. Petersburg Times, 9/7/2002][6]] Apparently, fighters don't meet up with Air Force One until over an hour and a half later (see [(11:29 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1055fightersfinally)). Counterterrorism "tsar" Richard Clarke will claim to have heard at around 9:50 a.m. from the White House bunker containing Vice President Dick Cheney that a fighter escort had been authorized. [[Clarke, 2004, pp. 8-9][7]]
