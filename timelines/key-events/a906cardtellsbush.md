Andrew Card, President Bush's chief of staff, enters the classroom where Bush is participating in a reading demonstration, and tells him about the second crash at the World Trade Center and that America is under attack. [[ABC News, 9/11/2002][1]; [NBC News, 9/10/2009][2]; [BBC, 9/9/2011][3]] Bush learned about the first hijacked plane crashing into the WTC when he arrived at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, shortly before 9:00 a.m. (see [(8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a855loewer) and [(Shortly After 8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a855bushfirsttold)). [[Associated Press, 11/26/2001][4]; [Rove, 2010, pp. 249-250][5]] He decided, though, to continue with the scheduled event at the school (see [(9:00 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a900uselessphotoop)). [[Associated Press, 8/25/2002][6]] Card was told about the second crash at the WTC by Deborah Loewer, director of the White House Situation Room, while he was in the "staff hold," a room adjacent to the classroom where the reading demonstration is taking place (see [Shortly After 9:03 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903cardblamesbinladen)). [[Dayton Daily News, 3/16/2013][7]; [Priess, 2016, pp. 240-241][8]] He decided that he needed to tell the president what had happened and went to pass on the news to Bush. [[NBC News, 9/10/2009][2]; [BBC, 9/9/2011][3]]

**Bush Is Told, 'America Is under Attack'** - In the classroom, the children have just finished a spelling and pronunciation drill, and are reaching for their textbooks for the second part of the reading demonstration. Card, who was waiting at the door, takes advantage of the lull. He walks across the room toward Bush, leans down, and whispers in the president's ear: "A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack." He then takes a couple of steps back so the president is unable to ask him any questions. [[Washington Times, 10/7/2002][9]; [Wall Street Journal, 3/22/2004][10]; [Bohn, 2015, pp. 214][11]; [Politico Magazine, 9/9/2016][12]] "There was no time for discussion or anything," Bush will later comment. Card then takes up a position at the side of the room, next to Florida Lieutenant Governor Frank Brogan. [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 83-84][13]] Card will explain why he gives such a brief message to Bush about the second crash, saying: "I knew that this was not the place to stand and have a conversation with the president. I just wanted to convey the situation to the president in stark reality and inviting him, then, to find the best chance to excuse himself from the classroom." [[White House, 8/12/2002][14]]

**Bush Feels 'Outrage' but Continues with the Event** - Bush will recall how he feels after hearing Card's message, writing: "My first reaction was outrage. Someone had dared attack America. They were going to pay." [[Bush, 2010, pp. 127][15]] "An expression of grim sobriety spread across the president's face" after Card speaks to him, journalist and author Bill Sammon will describe. "He raised his chin and nodded almost imperceptibly to signal that he got the message. His eyes darted nervously around the room, as if he didn't know quite where to focus them." [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 84][13]] However, even though it is now clear that America is under attack, the Secret Service takes no action to get Bush out of the classroom. "[N]o agents were there to surround the president and remove him instantly," author Philip Melanson will note. [[Melanson, 2005, pp. 330-331][16]] Instead, perhaps 15 or 30 seconds after Card speaks to him, Bush picks up his copy of the textbook and continues listening to the children reading. [[Tampa Tribune, 9/1/2002][17]]

**Bush Will Be Criticized for Continuing with the Event** - Intelligence expert and author James Bamford will criticize Bush for his lack of response to Card's devastating information, writing: "[H]aving just been told that the country was under attack, the commander in chief appeared uninterested in further details. He never asked if there had been any additional threats, where the attacks were coming from, how to best protect the country from further attacks, or what was the current status of NORAD or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Nor did he call for an immediate return to Washington. Instead, in the middle of a modern-day Pearl Harbor, he simply turned back to the matter at hand: the day's photo op." [[Bamford, 2002, pp. 633][18]] Bush, though, will explain his lack of response to the 9/11 Commission, telling it that "his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis." He will say that he "felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening." 

**Bush Remains in the Classroom for Several More Minutes** - Card tells Bush about the second crash at 9:05 a.m., according to the 9/11 Commission Report. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 38][19]] But ABC News reporter Ann Compton, who is in the classroom watching the reading demonstration, recognizes that something serious has happened when she sees Card interrupting the event and makes a note of the time, which her watch shows as 9:07 a.m. [[ABC News, 9/11/2002][1]] Bush will stay in the classroom for at least seven minutes after Card informs him of the second crash (see [(9:08 a.m.-9:13 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a906petgoat) and [(9:13 a.m.-9:15 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a916takestime)).
