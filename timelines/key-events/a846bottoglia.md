After being focused on Flight 11, Dave Bottiglia, an air traffic controller at the FAA's New York Center, first notices problems with Flight 175. [[MSNBC, 9/11/2002][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 21][2]] Both Flight 11 and Flight 175 have been in the airspace that Bottiglia is responsible for monitoring (see [8:40 a.m. September 11, 2001] and [(8:42 a.m.-8:46 a.m.) September 11, 2001]=). Bottiglia has just watched Flight 11's radar blip disappear, which means the plane has dipped below his radar's coverage area, so is below 2,000 feet. But he does not yet realize it has crashed. He says aloud, "Well, we know he's not high altitude anymore." [[MSNBC, 9/11/2002][1]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 37][3]] Around this time, Flight 175's transponder changes twice in the space of a minute (see [8:46 a.m.-8:47 a.m.  September 11, 2001]).

**Conflicting Accounts** - According to MSNBC, "within seconds" of losing Flight 11's blip, "Bottiglia has another unexpected problem." While looking for Flight 11, he realizes that Flight 175 is also missing, and "instinctivelyâ€¦ knows the two [planes] are somehow related." He asks another controller to take over all of his other planes. [[MSNBC, 9/11/2002][1]] But according to the 9/11 Commission's account, Bottiglia is still trying to locate Flight 11 after it crashes, and so it is not until 8:51 a.m. that he notices the problem with Flight 175 (see [8:51 a.m.-8:53 a.m. September 11, 2001]). [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 21][4]]

**'An Intruder over Allentown'** - Around the time Flight 175 changes its transponder code, air traffic controller Curt Applegate, who is sitting at the radar bank next to Bottiglia's, sees a blip that might be the missing Flight 11. He shouts out: "Look. There's an intruder over Allentown." According to the Washington Post, "In air traffic jargon, an 'intruder' is a plane with an operating transponder that has entered restricted airspace without permission." In fact, it is the missing Flight 175. [[Washington Post, 9/17/2001][5]; [MSNBC, 9/11/2002][1]] However, these accounts make no mention of NORAD being notified about the problems with Flight 175 at this time. But according to a NORAD timeline released shortly after 9/11, NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) was alerted about Flight 175 by the FAA several minutes earlier, at 8:43 a.m. (see [8:43 a.m. September 11, 2001]). [[North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][6]]
