The two F-15 fighter jets launched from Otis Air National Guard Base in response to Flight 11 (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846scramble)) have been directed to "Whiskey 105," a military airspace training area over the Atlantic Ocean, just south of Long Island. According to the 9/11 Commission, "To avoid New York area air traffic and uncertain about what to do, the fighters were brought down to military airspace to 'hold as needed.' From 9:09 to 9:13, the Otis fighters stayed in this holding pattern." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 20][1]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 85][2]] Otis pilot Major Daniel Nash will later comment, "Neither the civilian controller or the military controller knew what they wanted us to do." [[Cape Cod Times, 8/21/2002][3]]

**'Pushback' from FAA Controllers** - By 9:08 a.m., Major Kevin Nasypany, the NEADS mission crew commander, had learned of the second World Trade Center crash and wanted to send the Otis fighters to New York City. However, according to Vanity Fair, the NEADS "weapons techs get 'pushback' from civilian FAA controllers, who have final authority over the fighters as long as they are in civilian airspace. The FAA controllers are afraid of fast-moving fighters colliding with a passenger plane, of which there are hundreds in the area, still flying normal routes." [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 25][4]; [Vanity Fair, 8/1/2006][5]] Author Lynn Spencer will add: "[L]ocal FAA controllers are busy shutting down New York's airspace and are less than eager to grant the fighters access to the civilian airspace. They're afraid of fast-moving fighters colliding with the hundreds of airliners that are still in the area. Many of those flights are doing unpredictable things just now, such as canceling their flight plans and changing course, and controllers are not convinced that they can provide adequate separation if fast-moving fighters are added to the mix. They just need a few more minutes, they keep saying." 

**New York Center Not Answering Phone** - Nasypany tries contacting the military liaison at the FAA's New York Center, but no one is answering the phone. According to Spencer, "He wants the Otis fighters over New York, not in military airspace 100 miles off the coast, but he has little choice. Without permission from the FAA to penetrate the civil airspace over New York, NEADS must advise the Otis F-15 pilotsâ€¦ to continue to remain clear of the city." [[Spencer, 2008, pp. 111-112][2]]

**Director Wants Jets 'Closer In'** - At 9:10 a.m., the senior director on the NEADS operations floor tells the weapons director, "I want those fighters closer in." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 459][1]] NEADS weapons controller Major Steve Hedrick asks Major James Fox, the weapons team leader, "Can we give [the fighters] a mission?" Fox replies, "Right now their mission is to hold." [[Spencer, 2008, pp. 111][2]] Then, at around 9:11 a.m., either the senior weapons director at NEADS or his technician instructs the Otis fighters to "remain at current position [holding pattern] until FAA requests assistance." 

**Fighters Exit Holding Pattern for New York** - Just before 9:13 a.m., the Otis pilots tell their controller at the FAA's Boston Center that they need to establish a combat air patrol over New York. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 459][1]] According to the 9/11 Commission, "Radar data show that at 9:13, when the Otis fighters were about 115 miles away from the city, the fighters exited their holding pattern and set a course direct for Manhattan" (see [9:13 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a913otisheads)).
