Shortly after 9/11, NORAD reported that the FAA notified them at this time that Flight 77 "may" have been hijacked and that it appears headed toward Washington. [[Washington Post, 9/12/2001][1]; [CNN, 9/17/2001][2]; [North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][3]; [Guardian, 10/17/2001][4]; [Associated Press, 8/21/2002][5]] Apparently, flight controllers at Dulles International Airport discover a plane heading at high speed toward Washington; an alert is sounded within moments that the plane appears to be headed toward the White House. [[Washington Post, 11/3/2001][6]] In 2003, the FAA supported this account, but claimed that they had informally notified NORAD earlier. "NORAD logs indicate that the FAA made formal notification about American Flight 77 at 9:24 a.m. (see [(9:24 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a924faamaybenotify)), but information about the flight was conveyed continuously during the phone bridges before the formal notification." [[Federal Aviation Administration, 5/22/2003][7]] Yet in 2004, the 9/11 Commission claims that both NORAD and the FAA are wrong. The 9/11 Commission explains that the notification NEADS received at 9:24 a.m. was the incorrect information that Flight 11 had not hit the WTC and was headed south for Washington, D.C. Thus, according to the 9/11 Commission, NORAD is never notified by the FAA about the hijacking of Flight 77, but accidentally learns about it at 9:34 a.m. (see [9:34 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a934flightmissing)). [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][8]]
