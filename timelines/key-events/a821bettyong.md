Betty Ong, a flight attendant on Flight 11, begins relaying information about the trouble on her plane to employees at the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 5][1]] Ong has just called the reservations office to report the hijacking of Flight 11, and is on the line with two employees there: Vanessa Minter and Winston Sadler. [Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/12/2001, pp. 38-41][2]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 453][1]]

**Ong Describes Hijacking but Gives Wrong Flight Number** - Ong tells Minter and Sadler: "The cockpit's not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class, and I think there's Mace, that we can't breathe.â€¦ I think we're getting hijacked." Sadler asks Ong what flight she is on and Ong replies, incorrectly, "Flight 12." She says her plane just left Boston and is supposed to go to Los Angeles, and the pilots are not answering the phone in the cockpit. She says she is in the jump seat, 3R, which is at the back of the plane, behind the coach section. [[American Airlines, 9/11/2001, pp. 3-6][4]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 6, 8][5]] However, Amy Sweeney, another flight attendant who makes a call from Flight 11, is in the next-to-last row of passenger seats in the coach section of the plane, and she will say that Ong is sitting next to her (see [(8:32 a.m.-8:44 a.m.) September 11, 2001][21]). [[New York Observer, 2/15/2004][6]; [New York Observer, 6/20/2004][7]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 11][5]]

**Ong Says Two Flight Attendants Stabbed** - Sadler asks Ong her name and she replies: "My name is Betty Ong. I'm number three [flight attendant] on Flight 11." She says the number one flight attendant and the number five flight attendant have been stabbed. [[American Airlines, 9/11/2001, pp. 3-6][4]] These two attendants are Barbara Arestegui and Karen Martin. [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 6][5]] Ong says, "Nobody knows who stabbed who and we can't even get up to business class right now, 'cause nobody can breathe." She also says: "We can't get into the cockpit. The door won't open." [[American Airlines, 9/11/2001, pp. 3-6][4]] Sadler takes notes of the call, using his computer "scratch pad." [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/12/2001, pp. 42-44][12]] He notifies Ong of this, saying, "I'm taking it down, all the information." He tells Ong, "We're also, you know, of course, recording this." [[American Airlines, 9/11/2001, pp. 3-6][4]]

**Ong Receiving Details of Hijacking from Colleague** - During the entire conversation, Sadler will later recall, Ong seems to be talking to someone in the background and receiving information from them. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/12/2001, pp. 42-44][12]] This person is presumably Sara Low, another of the flight attendants, who was assigned to the front of the plane and so would have witnessed the hijacking when it happened. [[Associated Press, 3/5/2009][15]; [New York Daily News, 3/6/2009][16]; [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, 9/11/2011][17]] Ong will keep repeating herself during the call, Minter will recall, such as repeatedly mentioning the stabbings on her plane. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/12/2001, pp. 38-41][2]] Nydia Gonzalez, a supervisor at the reservations office, has been alerted to the call and will soon join it. [[9/11 Commission, 11/19/2003][19]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 453][1]]
