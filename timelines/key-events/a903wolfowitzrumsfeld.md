Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld goes ahead with his daily intelligence briefing in his office at the Pentagon, even though Denny Watson, his CIA briefer, urges him to cancel it and respond to the terrorist attacks. [[Rumsfeld, 2011, pp. 335][1]; [Priess, 2016, pp. 244][2]] Rumsfeld has just been in a meeting in his private dining room that was attended by several members of Congress (see [(8:00 a.m.-8:50 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a800breakfastmeeting)). During it, he was informed that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center (see [Shortly After 8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846rumsfeldlearns)). [[Associated Press, 9/12/2001][3]; [US Department of Defense, 12/5/2001][4]; [9/11 Commission, 3/23/2004][5]] He assumed the crash was an accident. [[Vogel, 2007, pp. 428][7]; [Rumsfeld, 2011, pp. 335][1]]

**Rumsfeld Went to His Office for His Intelligence Briefing** - After the meeting ended, apparently around 9:00 a.m., he returned to his office to receive his intelligence briefing. [[Historical Office, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 7/18/2002][6]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 37][8]] Rumsfeld receives an intelligence briefing from Watson each morning, similar to the intelligence briefing provided to the president each day. The briefings usually last at least half an hour. [[Rumsfeld, 2011, pp. 335][1]; [Priess, 2016, pp. 243][2]] The briefing today is scheduled to run from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. [[US Department of Defense, 8/12/2002][9]]

**CIA Briefer Learned of the Crashes from TV** - Watson, meanwhile, recently arrived at the Pentagon and learned about the crashes at the WTC. After she entered the building, she noticed people staring at a television, which showed the North Tower burning after being hit by a plane. She then went to the anteroom of Rumsfeld's office, where she saw the second hijacked plane crashing into the WTC live on television (see [9:03 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903flight175crashes)). She immediately called the operations center at CIA headquarters to see if she could find out more about what was happening. She was told only that there were 50 planes still airborne that were unaccounted for. 

**Rumsfeld Refuses to Cancel the Briefing** - Rumsfeld then calls Watson into his office. Assuming the briefing will be suspended due to what has happened in New York, the CIA analyst hasn't even opened her briefcase to pull out her copy of the President's Daily Brief (PDB). "Sir, you just need to cancel this," she says to Rumsfeld as she enters the office. "You've got more important things to do," she adds. Rumsfeld, however, wants to go ahead with the briefing. "No, no, we're going to do this," he says. Watson then sits down and tells Rumsfeld what she learned from the CIA's operations center, but the secretary of defense simply nods his head and starts flipping through the PDB. [[Priess, 2016, pp. 244][2]] The PDB apparently contains no remarkable information today. "As we reviewed the threat reports from around the world, September 11 seemed to be no more or less different than any other day," Rumsfeld will later comment. [[Rumsfeld, 2011, pp. 336][1]]

**Rumsfeld Will Be Receiving the Briefing When the Pentagon Is Hit** - Vice Admiral Edmund Giambastiani Jr., Rumsfeld's senior military assistant, will come into the office around this time and tell the secretary of defense about the second crash at the WTC (see [(Shortly After 9:03 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903rumsfeldcontinues)). [[Historical Office, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 7/18/2002][6]; [US Department of Defense, 8/12/2002][9]] Two of Rumsfeld's aides will also come to the office and, like Watson, try, unsuccessfully, to persuade Rumsfeld to cancel his schedule so he can respond to the attacks (see a904rumsfeldrefuses). [[Clarke, 2006, pp. 218-219][10]; [Priess, 2016, pp. 244][2]] Rumsfeld will be in his office with Watson, still receiving his intelligence briefing, at 9:37 a.m., when the Pentagon is attacked (see [9:37 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a937wheresrumsfeld)). [[Goldberg et al., 2007, pp. 130][11]; [Vogel, 2007, pp. 438-439][7]]
