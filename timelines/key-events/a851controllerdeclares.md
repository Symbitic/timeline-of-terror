According to the 9/11 Commission, Dave Bottiglia, the air traffic controller handling Flight 175, only notices now that this flight's transponder signal has changed (see [8:46 a.m.-8:47 a.m. September 11, 2001]). Bottiglia asks Flight 175 to return to its proper transponder code. There is no response. Beginning at 8:52 a.m., he makes repeated attempts to contact it, but there is still no response. Bottiglia contacts another controller at 8:53 a.m., and says: "We may have a hijack. We have some problems over here right now. I can't get a hold of UAL 175 at all right now and I don't know where he went to." [[New York Times, 10/16/2001][1]; [9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][2]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 48][3]] This account apparently conflicts with earlier accounts that claim NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) was notified at 8:43 a.m. that Flight 175 had been hijacked (see [8:43 a.m. September 11, 2001]). [[North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][4]]
