US airspace is clear of all civilian air traffic, with the exception of a small number of law enforcement and emergency operations aircraft. Otherwise, only military aircraft are airborne. [[Federal Aviation Administration, 9/18/2001][1]; [Federal Aviation Administration, 4/15/2002][2]; [USA Today, 8/12/2002][3]] The FAA's Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, announces that the airspace has been successfully shut down. [[Spencer, 2008, pp. 269][4]] At 9:26 a.m., the Command Center ordered a national ground stop that prevented any aircraft from taking off (see [(9:26 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a926flightban)), and at 9:45 a.m. it ordered FAA facilities to instruct all aircraft to land at the nearest airport (see [(9:45 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a945slineyorder)). Since then, about 4,500 commercial and general aviation aircraft have landed without incident. This is the first time ever that all civilian aircraft in the United States have been grounded. [[US Congress. House. Committee On Transportation And Infrastructure, 9/21/2001][5]; [Federal Aviation Administration, 3/21/2002][6]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 29][8]] Author Pamela Freni will later comment that this clearing of the skies was "a tremendous feat accomplished by a huge team that had never even practiced this part of the game before." Frank Hatfield, the air traffic division manager for the FAA's eastern region, will comment: "What we did on September 11 was done amazingly well. It was almost like World War II, the way the airplanes were handled." [[Freni, 2003, pp. 69][8]] At 12:30 p.m., the FAA will report that there are 50 flights in US airspace, but none of them are reporting any problems. [[CNN, 9/12/2001][9]]
