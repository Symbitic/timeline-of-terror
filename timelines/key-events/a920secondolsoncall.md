Barbara Olson, a passenger on Flight 77, talks over the phone with her husband, Ted Olson, the solicitor general of the United States, for a second time and is able to give him additional details of the hijacking of her plane before the call gets cut off. She has just called him at his office at the Department of Justice in Washington, DC, and was able to say her plane had been hijacked and give him details of the hijacking before the call got disconnected (see [(Between 9:15 a.m. and 9:25 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a920olsoncall)). [[CNN, 9/14/2001][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 9][2]] Since then, Ted Olson has called the Department of Justice command center and passed on the information she provided (see [(Between 9:17 a.m. and 9:29 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a925olson)). [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][3]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 32][4]]

**Secretary Answers the Call** - Shortly after making her first call to him, Barbara Olson calls Ted Olson again. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 9][2]] The call is initially answered by Lori Keyton, a secretary in Ted Olson's office. When Keyton picks up the phone, Barbara Olson says, "It's Barbara." Keyton says she will put her through to her husband. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][5]] Ted Olson is told his wife is on the phone again and the call is put through to him. 

**Barbara Olson Says Her Plane Has Been Circling Around** - Barbara Olson then gives her husband additional information about the hijacking of Flight 77. She says the pilot announced that the plane had been hijacked. Ted Olson asks if she has any idea of her plane's location. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][3]; [CNN, 9/14/2001][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 9][2]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 32][4]] She says the plane was hijacked shortly after takeoff and has been circling around for a while. [[CNN, 9/14/2001][1]; [Fox News, 9/14/2001][6]] (However, according to the 9/11 Commission Report, Flight 77 was hijacked between around 8:51 a.m. and 8:54 a.m. (see [8:51 a.m.-8:54 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a851hijackerstakeover)), more than 30 minutes after it took off (see [(8:20 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a820takeoff)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 8][2]] ) She says it is currently flying over some houses. After consulting another person on the plane, she says she thinks they are heading northeast. 

**Barbara Olson Asks What She Should Tell the Pilot** - Ted Olson says two aircraft, besides Flight 77, were hijacked this morning and these planes subsequently crashed into the World Trade Center. Barbara Olson "absorbed the information," the solicitor general will later recall. The couple then try to reassure each other. Ted Olson says, "It's going to come out okay" and Barbara Olson tells him the same thing. She then says, "I love you." Before the call ends, the couple "segued back and forth between expressions of feeling for one another and this effort to exchange information," Ted Olson will recall. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][3]; [CNN, 9/14/2001][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 9][2]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 32][4]] "We exchanged the feelings that a husband and wife who are extraordinarily close—as we are—those kind of sentiments," he will say. [[Fox News, 9/14/2001][6]] The last thing Barbara Olson says is: "What shall I tell the pilot? What can I tell the pilot to do?" This implies that either the plane's pilot or the co-pilot is at the back of the plane, where the hijackers moved the passengers, Ted Olson will note. [[Washington Post, 9/12/2001][7]; [CNN, 9/14/2001][1]]

**Call Is Abruptly Cut Off** - The call then ends abruptly, with the line suddenly going dead. It has lasted "two or three or four minutes," Ted Olson will estimate. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][3]; [CNN, 9/14/2001][1]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 32][4]] Ted Olson will then return to watching the coverage of the attacks at the WTC on television. When he sees the reports about an attack at the Pentagon, he will immediately think his wife's plane crashed there (see [(Shortly After 9:37 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a937olsonthinkscrash)). [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][3]; [Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][5]; [Fox News, 9/14/2001][6]]

**Call Is Made Sometime between 9:20 a.m. and 9:30 a.m.** - The exact time of Barbara Olson's second call to her husband is unclear. A list compiled by the Department of Justice supposedly showing all of the calls made today from Flight 77 will include four "connected calls to unknown numbers" (see [9:15 a.m.-9:30 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a915fourolsoncalls)) and the 9/11 Commission Report will determine that these include the two calls made by Barbara Olson. According to the information in the list, her second call must occur at 9:20 a.m., 9:25 a.m., or 9:30 a.m. and last for 4 minutes 34 seconds, 2 minutes 39 seconds, or 4 minutes 20 seconds. [[9/11 Commission, 5/20/2004][8]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 455][2]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 94][4]]

**Call Is Made Directly to Ted Olson's Office** - It is also unclear whether Barbara Olson makes this call using a cell phone or an Airfone. Keyton's phone has no caller identification feature and so she is unable to determine what kind of phone Barbara Olson uses. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][5]] But the Department of Justice will determine that all of the calls from Flight 77 were made using Airfones. [[9/11 Commission, 5/20/2004][8]] Barbara Olson makes the call by dialing "0," apparently in an attempt to reach an operator, according to an FBI report. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/20/2001][9]] But Keyton will say that, unlike the first call, Barbara Olson's second call to her husband is made directly to his office, rather than reaching it via an operator. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/11/2001][5]] And Mercy Lorenzo, the operator who connected Barbara Olson's first call to Ted Olson's office (see [(Between 9:15 a.m. and 9:25 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a915lorenzoolson)), will apparently mention dealing with only one call, not two, from Barbara Olson when she is interviewed by the FBI.
