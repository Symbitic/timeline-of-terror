The 9/11 Commission will later conclude that the four hijackers take over Flight 93 at 9:28 a.m., one minute after the plane's crew made their last communication with the FAA's Cleveland Center (see [9:27 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a927lastcontact)). According to the Commission, the hijackers "wielded knives (reported by at least five callers); engaged in violence, including stabbing (reported by at least four callers and indicated by the sounds of the cockpit struggle transmitted over the radio); relocated the passengers to the back of the plane (reported by at least two callers); threatened use of a bomb, either real or fake (reported by at least three callers); and engaged in deception about their intentions (as indicated by the hijacker's radio transmission received by FAA air traffic control)." Flight 93 suddenly drops 685 feet in the space of just 30 seconds, and the Cleveland Center hears two suspicious radio transmissions from its cockpit (see [(9:28 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a928struggle)). However, the 9/11 Commission will add, "While this appears to show the exact time that the hijackers invaded the cockpit, we have found no conclusive evidence to indicate precisely when the terrorists took over the main cabin or moved passengers seated in the first-class cabin back to coach." The four hijackers waited about 46 minutes after takeoff before beginning their takeover of Flight 93. [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 38-39][1]] Yet, the Commission claims, when alleged hijacker ringleader Mohamed Atta met with fellow Hamburg cell member Ramzi bin al-Shibh in Spain about two months earlier (see [July 8-19, 2001](/timeline/#a070801spainmeeting)), he'd said that the "best time [for the hijackers] to storm the cockpit would be about 10-15 minutes after takeoff, when the cockpit doors typically were opened for the first time." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 245][2]] The Commission will state, "We were unable to determine why [the Flight 93 hijackers] waited so long." [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 39][1]] The long wait is particularly notable, considering that Flight 93 had already been significantly delayed before taking off from Newark Airport (see [8:01 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a801delay)). In fact, in an early timeline, Pentagon officials will state the hijacking occurred significantly earlier, at around 9:16, and in 2003, NORAD officials repeat this claim (see [9:16 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a916originalnoradtime)).
