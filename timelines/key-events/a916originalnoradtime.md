According to an early timeline laid out to CNN by unnamed but "informed defense officials," the FAA informs NORAD at this time that Flight 93 may have been hijacked. [[CNN, 9/17/2001][1]] In public testimony before the 9/11 Commission in 2003, NORAD officials will similarly claim that the FAA first reports the possible hijacking of Flight 93 at this time. [[9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][2]] Yet this is 12 minutes before the hijacking is meant to have occurred (see [(9:28 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a928struggle)). [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 38][3]] One explanation is put forward that could possibly help explain the discrepancy: There are media reports that "investigators had determined from the cockpit voice recorder from United Airlines Flight 93â€¦ that one of the four hijackers had been invited into the cockpit area before the flight took off from Newark, New Jersey." Cockpit voice recordings indicate that the pilots believed their guest was a colleague "and was thereby extended the typical airline courtesy of allowing any pilot from any airline to join a flight by sitting in the jumpseat, the folded over extra seat located inside the cockpit." [[Fox News, 9/24/2001][4]] This would be consistent with passenger phone calls from the plane, describing only three hijackers on Flight 93 (see [(9:27 a.m.-10:03 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a927threehijackers)). [[Longman, 2002, pp. 120][5]] However, the reports will not be confirmed. The 9/11 Commission Report will dismiss the claim that NORAD was alerted at 9:16, stating, "In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 34][6] No further explanations will be offered for the incorrect timelines. NORAD's own initial timeline, released on September 18, 2001, will not give a time for when the FAA alerted it to Flight 93. It will only say that the FAA and its Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) "established a line of open communication discussing AA Flt 77 and UA Flt 93."
