National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice tries to gather together the principals of the National Security Council (NSC), but is unable to get in touch with key officials. Rice realized the US was under terrorist attack during a staff meeting, when her assistant informed her of the second plane striking the World Trade Center (see [(9:04 a.m.) September 11, 2001]((/timeline/#a903ricelearns)). She had then headed to the White House Situation Room's operations center. [[Newsweek, 12/30/2001][1]; [Bumiller, 2007, pp. xii][2]] Here she intends to assemble the principals of the NSC for a crisis meeting. [[O, the Oprah Magazine, 2/1/2002][3]] Along with the national security adviser, the principal members of the NSC are the president, the vice president, the secretary of state, the secretary of the treasury, and the secretary of defense; additionally, the CIA director and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are statutory advisers to the NSC. [[US President, 2/13/2001][4]; [Felix, 2002, pp. 226][5]] However, Rice remembers that Secretary of State Colin Powell is currently away in Peru (see [(8:30 a.m.) September 11, 2001]((/timeline/#a830leadersscrambled)). [[MSNBC, 9/11/2002][6]] Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is away in Japan. [[US Department of the Treasury, 11/29/2001][7]; [US Department of the Treasury, 1/23/2002][8]] And Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Henry Shelton is on his way to Europe for a NATO meeting there. [[CNN, 10/1/2001][9]] Rice tries calling Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who is in his office at the Pentagon (see [(Shortly After 9:03 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903wolfowitzrumsfeld)), but cannot reach him. [[PBS Frontline, 7/12/2002][10]; [Clarke, 2006, pp. 218-219][11]; [Cockburn, 2007, pp. 1][12]] She is also unable to get a call through to CIA Director George Tenet. [[Bumiller, 2007, pp. xii][2]] (Tenet will later claim that, around this time, he is having trouble using his secure phone while being driven out to CIA headquarters (see [(8:55 a.m.-9:15 a.m.) September 11, 2001]((/timeline/#a855tenetreturns)). [[Tenet, 2007, pp. 161-162][13]]) Also around this time, in the Secure Video Conferencing Center just off the main floor of the Situation Room, counterterrorism "tsar" Richard Clarke is trying to convene a video teleconference with other top officials (see [(9:10 a.m.) September 11, 2001]((/timeline/#a910clarkeconference)). [[Bumiller, 2007, pp. xii][2]]
