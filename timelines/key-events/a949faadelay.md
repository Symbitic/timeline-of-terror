John White, a manager at the FAA's Command Center, suggests to Doug Davis, the special assistant for technical operations in air traffic services at FAA headquarters, that fighter jets should be launched in response to Flight 93. However, FAA headquarters is apparently unable to act on this suggestion. [[Federal Aviation Administration, 10/21/2002][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 29][2]; [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 9/10/2006][3]] In the last few minutes, the Command Center has warned headquarters that Flight 93 is "29 minutes out of Washington" and approaching the city (see [9:41 a.m.-9:48 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a941faaupdates)). [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 44][4]]

**Command Center Asks about Launching Fighters** - Davis now tells White, "They're pulling Jeff [Griffith, the FAA's deputy director of air traffic] away to go talk about United 93." White asks, "Uh, do we want to think, uh, about scrambling aircraft?" Davis replies, "Oh, God, I don't know." White says, "Uh, that's a decision somebody's gonna have to make probably in the next 10 minutes." However, Davis only responds, "Uh, ya know everybody just left the room." [[Federal Aviation Administration, 10/21/2002][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 29][2]] This conversation takes place 13 minutes after the FAA's Cleveland Center asked the Command Center whether anyone had asked the military to launch fighter jets to intercept Flight 93 (see [(9:36 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a936clevelandwants)). [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 40][4]]

**Person Who Could Request Fighters Is Unavailable** - Apparently there is only one person at FAA headquarters who is authorized to request military assistance, and Ben Sliney, the Command Center's national operations manager, is told that no one can find him. Sliney will later recount: "I said something like, 'That's incredible. There's only one person. There must be someone designated or someone who will assume the responsibility of issuing an order, you know.' We were becoming frustrated in our attempts to get some information. What was the military response?" [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 9/10/2006][3]] This lack of response to Flight 93 contrasts with the FAA's earlier reaction to Flight 11, when Boston Center air traffic controllers contacted NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) themselves (see [(8:37 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a837noradnotified)), and even called military bases directly (see [8:34 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a834capecod) and [(8:34 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a833atlanticcity)).
