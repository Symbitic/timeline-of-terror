After 9/11, NORAD and other sources will claim that NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) is notified at this time that Flight 175 has been hijacked. [[Washington Post, 9/12/2001][1]; [CNN, 9/17/2001][2]; [North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][3]; [Associated Press, 8/19/2002]; [Newsday, 9/10/2002]] However, the FAA's New York Center, which is handling Flight 175, first alerts its military liaison about the hijacking at around 9:01 (see [9:01 a.m.-9:02 a.m. September 11, 2001]). In addition, according to the 9/11 Commission, NEADS is not informed until two minutes later (see [(9:03 a.m.) September 11, 2001]). [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][4]] According to the Commission, the first "operational evidence" that there is something wrong on Flight 175 is not until 8:47, when its transponder code changes (see [8:46 a.m.-8:47 a.m. September 11, 2001]), and it is not until 8:53 that the air traffic controller handling it concludes that Flight 175 may be hijacked (see [8:51 a.m.-8:53 a.m. September 11, 2001]). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 7, 21-22][5]]
