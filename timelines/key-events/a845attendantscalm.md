Amy Sweeney, a flight attendant on Flight 11, gives updates over the phone to Michael Woodward, an American Airlines flight services manager at Logan International Airport in Boston, as her plane approaches the World Trade Center, and then, after she reports that the plane is flying "very, very low," the line goes dead. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 1-2][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 6-7][2]] Sweeney has been on the phone with the American Airlines flight services office at Logan Airport since 8:32 a.m., describing to Woodward the trouble on her plane (see [(8:32 a.m.-8:44 a.m.) September 11, 2001]). [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 11][3]]

**Sweeney Says Plane Is 'in a Rapid Descent'** - She now tells Woodward: "Something is wrong. We are in a rapid descent." She says her plane is flying "all over the place." [[9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][3]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 14][3]] Around this time, Woodward tells Nancy Wyatt, another employee in the flight services office, that Sweeney has "started screaming that there's something wrong with the airplane." He adds: "In other words [the original pilot is] not flying the airplane. They're not flying the airplane." [[American Airlines, 9/11/2001, pp. 34-41][5]]

Sweeney Says Plane Is Flying 'Very Low' - Woodward asks Sweeney to look out of the window to see if she can determine where her plane is. [[9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][4]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 14][3]] In an interview with the FBI a couple of days later, Woodward will say that Sweeney tells him: "I see water. I see buildings. We're very, very low. Oh my God." [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 1-2][1]] In 2004, he will give a slightly different account, telling the 9/11 Commission that Sweeney says: "We are flying low. We are flying very, very low. We are flying way too low." Seconds later she says, "Oh my God, we are way too low." [[9/11 Commission, 1/25/2004][4]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 14][3]] Sweeney says "Oh my God" after taking "a very slow, deep breath," Woodward will tell ABC News. She says these final words "[v]ery slowly, very calmly, very quietly. It wasn't in panic," Woodward will say. 

Call Suddenly Cut Off - Woodward then hears what he will describe as "very, very loud static on the other end" of the line. [[ABC News, 7/18/2002][6]] After a short time, the line goes dead. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 1-2][1]] Woodward looks up from the phone and tells everyone else in the office that the line has died. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 3-4][1]] Wyatt is on the phone with Ray Howland, an employee at the American Airlines System Operations Control center in Fort Worth, Texas, and has been passing on to him the information that Sweeney was providing to Woodward (see [8:40 a.m.-8:48 a.m. September 11, 2001]). She now informs Howland, "Okay, we just lost connection" with Sweeney. [[American Airlines, 9/11/2001, pp. 34-41][5]; [Rutgers Law Review, 9/7/2011, pp. 14][7]]

Flight Services Office Personnel Learn of Crash at WTC - Shortly after Sweeney's call is cut off, Woodward's operational manager, Craig Kopetz, will enter the flight services office and say that a plane has just crashed into the WTC. Woodward will not initially connect this news with the crisis he has been dealing with. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 1-2][1]; [ABC News, 7/18/2002][6]] Those in the flight services office will then go to their command center. "Approximately 15 minutes later," according to Elizabeth Williams, one of Woodward's colleagues, the group will realize that "Flight 11 was the same flight which crashed into the WTC." [[Federal Bureau of Investigation, 9/13/2001, pp. 3-4][1]] The call between Sweeney and Woodward lasts "approximately 12 minutes" and ends at around 8:44 a.m., according to the 9/11 Commission. [[9/11 Commission, 2004, pp. 4][8]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 11, 14][3]] But according to a summary of phone calls from the hijacked flights presented at the 2006 trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the call began at 8:32 a.m. and 39 seconds, and lasts 13 minutes and 13 seconds, meaning it ends at 8:45 a.m. and 52 seconds. [[US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, 7/31/2006][9]] Flight 11 crashes into the WTC less than a minute later, at 8:46 a.m. (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001]). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 7][2]]
