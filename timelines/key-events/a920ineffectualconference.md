The FAA sets up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. This is almost one hour after the FAA's Boston flight control began notifying the chain of command (see [8:25 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a825bostonnotifies)) and notified other flight control centers about the first hijacking at 8:25 a.m. (see [8:25 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a825othercenters)). According to the Acting FAA Deputy Administrator Monte Belger, this teleconference (called the "hijack net") is "the fundamental primary source of information between the FAA, [Defense Department], FBI, Secret Service, and… other agencies." Yet even after the delay in setting it up, FAA and Defense Department participants later claim it plays no role in coordinating the response to the hijackings. The 9/11 Commission says, "The NMCC [National Military Command Center inside the Pentagon] officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit." [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 36][2]] According to a statement provided by the FAA to the 9/11 Commission in 2003, this teleconference began significantly earlier—"[w]ithin minutes after the first aircraft hit the World Trade Center" (see [(8:50 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a850phonebridges)).
