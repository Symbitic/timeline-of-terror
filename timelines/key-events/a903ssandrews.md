The Secret Service calls the District of Columbia Air National Guard (DCANG) at Andrews Air Force Base, just outside Washington, and asks if it can get fighter jets launched. [[Filson, 2003, pp. 78][1]]

**Secret Service Calls DCANG** - Major Daniel Caine, the supervisor of flying with the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard, which is based at Andrews, called his contact at the Secret Service earlier on to see if they needed assistance from his unit, but was told they did not (see [(Between 9:05 a.m. and 9:32 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a905nohelp)). But the Secret Service has just learned of a suspicious aircraft five miles from the White House (see [(9:33 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a933reagancalls) and [(9:33 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a933dullescontacts)), and so one of its agents now calls Caine back. [[Federal Aviation Administration, 9/17/2001][2]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 124, 156][3]] Caine's previous call to the Secret Service had been with agent Kenneth Beauchamp, who told Caine he would call back. However, he did not do so. The name of the agent that makes the current call is unstated. [[9/11 Commission, 3/8/2004][4]]

**Agent Wants Planes Launched** - The Secret Service agent asks, "Can you get airplanes up?" He then tells Caine to stand by, and says somebody else will call. Caine will later recall, "When I heard the tone in his voice, I called our bomb dump and told them to uncrate our missiles." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 78][1]] But before Caine does this, Lieutenant Colonel Marc Sasseville, the acting operations group commander under the 113th Wing, calls Brigadier General David Wherley, the commander of the 113th Wing, to get permission to use their "war-reserve missiles." Wherley gives the go-ahead, and then Caine calls the weapons loaders across the base and orders them, "Get some live AIM-9s [missiles] and bring them over!" At the same time, Sasseville calls the unit's maintenance officer and orders that their jets be prepared for launch (see [(9:35 a.m.-11:05 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a935dcangunloads)). [[Aviation Week and Space Technology, 9/9/2002][5]; [9/11 Commission, 3/8/2004][4]; [Spencer, 2008, pp. 156-157][3]] Someone from the Secret Service's White House Joint Operations Center will soon call Caine, and request that armed fighters be launched over Washington (see [(Shortly After 9:35 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a935jocrequest)). [[Filson, 2003, pp. 78][1]; [9/11 Commission, 3/11/2004][6]]
