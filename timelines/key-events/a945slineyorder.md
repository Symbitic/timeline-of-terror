Ben Sliney, FAA's National Operations Manager, orders the entire nationwide air traffic system shut down. All flights at US airports are stopped. Around 3,950 flights are still in the air. Sliney makes the decision without consulting FAA head Jane Garvey, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, or other bosses, but they quickly approve his actions. It's Sliney's first day on the job. [[CNN, 9/12/2001][1]; [Washington Post, 9/12/2001][2]; [MSNBC, 9/22/2001][3]; [USA Today, 8/12/2002][4]; [Associated Press, 8/12/2002][5]; [USA Today, 8/12/2002][4]; [USA Today, 8/13/2002][6]; [Associated Press, 8/21/2002][7]] Seventy-five percent of the planes land within one hour of the order. [[USA Today, 8/12/2002][8]] The 9/11 Commission will later remark that this "was an unprecedented order" that the "air traffic control system handledâ€¦ with great skill." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 29][9]] The Washington Post has reported that Mineta told Monte Belger at the FAA: "Monte, bring all the planes down," even adding, "[Expletive] pilot discretion." [[Washington Post, 1/27/2002][10]] However, it is later reported by a different Post reporter that Mineta did not even know of the order until 15 minutes later. This reporter "says FAA officials had begged him to maintain the fiction." [[Slate, 4/2/2002][11]]
