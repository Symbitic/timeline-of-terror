Larry Di Rita, a special assistant to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, has sent a note to Rumsfeld to inform him of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center. Although some initial reports suggest the WTC may have been hit by just a small plane, according to Victoria Clarke, the assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, "Even in the accidental crash scenario, the military might be involved in some way. Rumsfeld needed to know." Rumsfeld, who is currently hosting a breakfast meeting with several members of Congress, later acknowledges having received this note. Yet apparently he does nothing in response. He recalls, "Everyone assumed it was an accident, the way it was described." He says only that "we adjourned the meeting, and I went in to get my CIA briefing."
