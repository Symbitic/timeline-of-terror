The three F-16s that took off from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia (see [(9:25 a.m.-9:30 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a930langleylaunch)) head east, out over the Atlantic Ocean, instead of north toward the Baltimore area, as NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) instructed when it issued the scramble order (see [9:24 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a924langleyscramble)). [[New York Times, 11/15/2001][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 27][2]]

**Three Reasons Jets Head East** - The 9/11 Commission will give three reasons why the Langley jets go east instead of north: "First, unlike a normal scramble order, this order did not include a distance to the target or the target's location. Second, a 'generic' flight plan—prepared to get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quickly—incorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were ordered to fly due east (090) for 60 miles. Third, the lead pilot and local FAA controller incorrectly assumed the flight plan instruction to go '090 for 60' superseded the original scramble order." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 27][2]]

**NORAD Commander Blames 'Peacetime Rules'** - In his testimony before the 9/11 Commission in May 2003, Larry Arnold, the commanding general of NORAD's Continental US Region, will address the question of why the Langley jets head out over the sea. He says, "When we scramble an aircraft… the aircraft take off and they have a predetermined departure route." According to Arnold, NORAD is "looking outward," and so "our mission, unlike law enforcement's mission, is to protect things coming towards the United States." He concludes, "So our peacetime procedures, to de-conflict with civil aviation's, so as to not have endanger[ed] civil aviation in any particular way." Arnold will also suggest that "peacetime rules" might be partly to blame for the Langley jets heading in the wrong direction. He says, "[I]f we were operating under something other than peacetime rules… they could have turned immediately toward Washington, DC." [[9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][3]] According to the Wall Street Journal, the "peacetime rules" Arnold refers to are "noise restrictions requiring that [the Langley jets] fly more slowly than supersonic speed and take off over water, pointed away from Washington." [[Wall Street Journal, 3/22/2004][4]] One of the Langley pilots, Captain Craig Borgstrom, will later recall that, shortly after the jets take off, NEADS "gave us max-subsonic," which is "as fast as you can go without breaking the sound barrier." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 65][5]]

**Risk of Midair Collision** - NORAD official Major General Craig McKinley will tell the 9/11 Commission that "another reason why" the Langley jets are "vectored east originally" is that "the air traffic over the Northeast corridor is so complex that to just launch fighters… into that air traffic system can cause potential damage or midair collision. So we rely on the FAA to de-conflict those corridors." [[9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][3]]

**Jets Far Away from Pentagon** - When the Pentagon is hit at 9:37 a.m., the Langley jets have flown nearly 60 miles out over the ocean and are 150 miles from Washington (see [9:37 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a937langleyshort)).
