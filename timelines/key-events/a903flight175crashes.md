Flight 175 hits the South Tower of the World Trade Center (Tower Two). Seismic records pinpoint the time at six seconds before 9:03 a.m. (rounded to 9:03 a.m.). Hijackers Marwan Alshehhi, Fayez Ahmed Banihammad, Mohand Alshehri, Hamza Alghamdi, and Ahmed Alghamdi presumably are killed instantly, and many more in the tower will die over the next few hours. [[New York Times, 9/12/2001]; [CNN, 9/12/2001][1]; [CNN, 9/17/2001][2]; [North American Aerospace Defense Command, 9/18/2001][3]; [USA Today, 12/20/2001][4]; [Federal Emergency Management Agency, 5/1/2002, pp. 1-10][5]; [New York Times, 5/26/2002][6]; [Associated Press, 8/21/2002][7]; [USA Today, 9/2/2002][8]] According to the NIST report, the crash time is 9:02:59. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 38][9]] According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the crash time is 9:03:11. [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 8][10]] Millions watch the crash live on television. The plane strikes the 77th through 85th floors in the 110-story building. Approximately 100 people are killed or injured in the initial impact; 600 people in the tower eventually die. The death toll is far lower than in the North Tower because about two-thirds of the South Tower's occupants have evacuated the building in the 17 minutes since the first tower was struck. [[USA Today, 12/20/2001][4]; [National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 5-9, 41][9]] The combined death toll from the two towers is estimated at 2,819, not including the hijackers. [[Associated Press, 8/21/2002][7]] The impact severs some columns on the south side of the South Tower. Each of the Twin Towers is designed as a "tube-in-tube" structure and the steel columns which support its weight are arranged around the perimeter and in the core. The plane, which is traveling at an estimated speed of around 500 mph (see [October 2002-October 2005](/timeline/#a1002speedindispute)), severs 33 of the building's 236 perimeter columns and damages another one. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 39][9]] The perimeter columns bear about half of the tower's weight, so the damage to them reduces the tower's ability to bear gravity loads by about 7.1 percent. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 6][9]] The actual damage to the 47 core columns is not known, as there are no photographs or videos of it, but there will be much speculation about this after 9/11. It will be suggested that some parts of the aircraft may be able to damage the core even after crashing through the exterior wall (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846flight11hits)). [[National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 107][9]] According to NIST's base case model, five of the core columns are severed and another five suffer some damage. [[National Institute of Standards & Technology, 9/2005, pp. 235][11]] This may reduce the tower's ability to bear loads by a further approximately 8 percent, meaning that the aircraft impact accounted for a loss of about 15 percent of the building's strength. This damage will be cited as an event contributing to the building's collapse after 9/11 (see [October 23, 2002](/timeline/#a102302silversteinstudy) and [October 19, 2004](/timeline/#a101904nisthypothesis)). NIST's base case estimate of damage to the North Tower's core will be similar, even though the aircraft impact there was dissimilar (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846flight11hits)). Flight 11 hit the North Tower's core head on, whereas Flight 175 only hits the corner of the South Tower's core. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 20-23, 38-41][9]] In addition, some of the fireproofing on the steel columns and trusses may be dislodged (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846flight11hits)). [[National Institute of Standards & Technology, 9/2005, pp. xxxvi, 83][12]] Photographs and videos of the towers will not show the state of fireproofing inside the buildings, but the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will try to estimate the damage to fireproofing using a series of computer models. Its severe case model (see [(October 2002-October 2005)](/timeline/#a1002nistadjusts)) will predict that 39 of the 47 core columns are stripped of their fireproofing on one or more floors and that fireproofing is stripped from trusses covering 80,000 ft2 of floor area, the equivalent of about two floors. NIST will say that the loss of fireproofing is a major cause of the collapse (see [April 5, 2005](/timeline/#a040505nistfindings)), but only performs 15 tests on fireproofing samples (see [October 26, 2005](/timeline/#a102605fireproofingtests)). [[National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 41][9]] According to NIST, less fireproofing is stripped from the North Tower (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846flight11hits)).
