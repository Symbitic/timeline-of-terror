One of the hijackers in the cockpit asks if anything is going on, apparently meaning outside the cockpit. "Fighting," the other says. [[Longman, 2002, pp. 210][1]] An analysis of the cockpit flight recording suggests that the passenger struggle actually starts in the front of the plane (where Mark Bingham and Tom Burnett are sitting) about a minute before a struggle in the back of the plane (where Todd Beamer is sitting). [[Observer, 12/2/2001][2]] Officials later theorize that the Flight 93 passengers reach the cockpit using a food cart as a battering ram and a shield. They claim digital enhancement of the cockpit voice recorder reveals the sound of plates and glassware crashing around 9:57 a.m. [[Newsweek, 12/3/2001][3]]
