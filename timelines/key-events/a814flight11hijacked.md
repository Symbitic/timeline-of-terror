The 9/11 Commission will later conclude that Flight 11 is hijacked at 8:14 or shortly after. It will state, "Information supplied by eyewitness accounts indicates that the hijackers initiated and sustained their command of the aircraft using knives (as reported by two flight attendants); violence, including stabbing and slashing (as reported by two flight attendants); the threat of violence (as indicated by a hijacker in radio transmissions received by air traffic control); Mace (reported by one flight attendant); the threat of a bomb, either fake or real (reported by one flight attendant); and deception about their intentions (as indicated by a hijacker in a radio transmission received by air traffic control)." [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 8][1]] The Commission says, "We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight.â€¦ Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 5][2] Pilots are trained to handle hijackings by staying calm, complying with any requests, and, if possible, dialing an emergency four-digit code on their plane's transponder. It only takes a few seconds to dial this code. [[CNN, 9/12/2001][3]] Yet, as the Boston Globe notes, "It appears that the hijackers' entry was surprising enough that the pilots did not have a chance to broadcast a traditional distress call" (see [(8:13 a.m.-9:28 a.m.) September 11, 2001][10]). [[Boston Globe, 11/23/2001][4]] The Los Angeles Times reports that, when flight attendant Amy Sweeney makes a phone call from the plane, she says the hijackers have "just gained access to the cockpit." [[Los Angeles Times, 9/20/2001][5]] Yet her first attempted call is not until 8:22, and, according to official accounts, her first call that stays connected is at 8:25, well past when the 9/11 Commission says the hijacker takeover occurs. [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 9-10][6]; [US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, 7/31/2006][7]] According to an employee at the FAA's Boston Center, Flight 11 is hijacked while it is over Gardner, Massachusetts, about 45 miles northwest of Boston.
