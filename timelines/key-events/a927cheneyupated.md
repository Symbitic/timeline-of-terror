According to some accounts, Vice President Dick Cheney is in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) below the White House by this time, along with Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta and others. Mineta will recall that, while a suspicious plane is heading toward Washington, an unidentified young man comes in and says to Cheney, "The plane is 50 miles out." Mineta confers with acting FAA Deputy Administrator Monte Belger, who is at the FAA's Washington headquarters. Belger says to him: "We're watching this target on the radar, but the transponder's been turned off. So we have no identification." According to Mineta, the young man continues updating the vice president, saying, "The plane is 30 miles out," and when he gets down to "The plane is 10 miles out," asks, "Do the orders still stand?" In response, Cheney "whipped his neck around and said, 'Of course the orders still stand. Have you heard anything to the contrary?'" Mineta will say that, "just by the nature of all the events going on," he infers that the order being referred to is a shootdown order. Nevertheless, Flight 77 continues on and hits the Pentagon. [[BBC, 9/1/2002][1]; [ABC News, 9/11/2002][2]; [9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][3]; [9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][4]; [St. Petersburg Times, 7/4/2004][5]] However, the 9/11 Commission will later claim the plane heading toward Washington is only discovered by the Dulles Airport air traffic control tower at 9:32 a.m. (see [9:32 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a932headeddc)). But earlier accounts, including statements made by the FAA and NORAD, will claim that the FAA notified the military about the suspected hijacking of Flight 77 at 9:24 a.m., if not before (see [9:24 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a924faamaybenotify)). The FBI's Washington Field Office was also reportedly notified that Flight 77 had been hijacked at about 9:20 a.m. (see [9:20 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a920fbiwarnedflight77)). The 9/11 Commission will further contradict Mineta's account saying that, despite the "conflicting evidence as to when the vice president arrived in the shelter conference room [i.e., the PEOC]," it has concluded that he only arrived there at 9:58 a.m. [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][6]] According to the Washington Post, the discussion between Cheney and the young aide over whether "the orders" still stand occurs later than claimed by Mineta, and is in response to Flight 93 heading toward Washington, not Flight 77.
