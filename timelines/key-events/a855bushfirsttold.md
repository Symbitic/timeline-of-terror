President Bush is told that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center for the first time by Karl Rove, his senior adviser, according to some accounts, although other accounts will state that he is first alerted to the crash by another member of his staff. Bush has just arrived at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, where he is going to attend a children's reading event (see [(8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a855busharrives)). [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 41-42][1]; [Bush, 2010, pp. 126][2]; [Rove, 2010, pp. 249-250][3]; [Priess, 2016, pp. 240][4]; [Politico Magazine, 9/9/2016][5]]

**Rove Tells Bush about the Crash** - During the drive to the school, several members of his staff were informed about the crash at the WTC (see [(Between 8:48 a.m. and 8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a846motorcadetold)). [[White House, 8/12/2002][6]; [Dayton Daily News, 8/17/2003][7]] Rove received a call alerting him to what had happened as he was arriving at the school (see [(8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a855ralstoncallsrove)). He will later recall that he then walks over to Bush, who is "with Secretary of Education Rod Paige, shaking hands with staff and teachers outside the school," and tells him about the crash. [[New Yorker, 9/25/2001][8]; [Rove, 2010, pp. 249-250][3]; [Politico Magazine, 9/9/2016][5]] White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who arrived at the school around the time the president did, will give a similar account, writing that while Bush is shaking "hands with the teachers and staff who had lined up to greet him," Rove "stepped beside the president and told him about the plane" hitting the WTC. [[Fleischer, 2005, pp. 138-139][9]]

**Bush Thinks the Crash Was 'a Terrible Accident'** - Rove tells Bush the crash appears to have been an accident involving a small, twin-engine plane. [[Washington Post, 1/27/2002][10]] Bush nods his head, gives "a quizzical look," and says, "Get more details," Rove will describe. [[Rove, 2010, pp. 250][3]] The president's initial thoughts in response to the news are: "How could the [pilot] have gotten so off course to hit the towers? What a terrible accident that is." [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 42][1]; [Washington Times, 10/7/2002][11]] He says: "This is pilot error. It's unbelievable that somebody would do this." He confers with Andrew Card, his chief of staff, and says the plane's pilot "must have had a heart attack." [[Washington Post, 1/27/2002][10]]

**Someone Else First Gives Bush the News, Other Accounts Will State** - Rove will claim that he "was the first to tell [Bush] the news" about the crash. [[Rove, 2010, pp. 250][3]] However, according to other accounts, Bush is first told about the crash by some other member of the White House staff. For example, Navy Captain Deborah Loewer, director of the White House Situation Room, will say she was the first person to inform Bush about it, running up to his limousine and giving him the news as soon as he arrived at the school (see [(8:55 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a855loewer)). [[Associated Press, 11/26/2001][12]; [Dayton Daily News, 8/17/2003][7]; [Priess, 2016, pp. 240][4]] And in 2002, Bush will tell journalist and author Bill Sammon that he was first told about the crash by Card. He will say that as he was heading into the school, while Blake Gottesman, his personal aide, was giving him some final instructions in preparation for the reading event, Card said to him, "By the way, an aircraft flew into the World Trade Center." [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 41-42][1]; [Washington Times, 10/7/2002][11]] But on other occasions, Bush will state that he was first told about the crash by Rove. [[Washington Post, 1/27/2002][10]; [Bush, 2010, pp. 126][2]] Bush is also told about the crash, after he arrives at the school, by Dan Bartlett, his communications director, according to some accounts. In response to the news, Bartlett will say, Bush asks, "Was it bad weather [that caused the crash]?" [[White House, 8/12/2002][6]; [Draper, 2007, pp. 135][13]] After learning about the crash, Bush will go to a classroom from where he will talk on the phone with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who is at the White House, and discuss what has happened with her (see [(Shortly Before 9:00 a.m.) September 11, 2001](#a900riceinforms)). [[Washington Times, 10/7/2002][11]; [Bush, 2010, pp. 126-127][2]]
