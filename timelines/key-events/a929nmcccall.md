The National Military Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon finally commences and runs a "significant event conference" in response to the ongoing crisis, 26 minutes after the second plane hit the World Trade Center and officers in the NMCC realized the US was under terrorist attack. [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][1]; [9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 37][2]; [American Forces Press Service, 9/7/2006][3]]

**NMCC Directors Decided to Establish Conference** - After those in the NMCC saw Flight 175 hitting the WTC live on television at 9:03 a.m. (see [9:03 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903nmccresponds)), Captain Charles Leidig, the acting deputy director for operations (DDO) in the center throughout the attacks, and Commander Pat Gardner, the assistant DDO, talked about the need to convene a significant event conference so there could be a discussion of what actions were to be taken in response. The DDO and the assistant DDO are the two officers responsible for deciding what type of conference the NMCC should convene, and when it should do so. Because there is no specific procedure for dealing with terrorist attacks, Leidig and Gardner decided a significant event conference would most suit their needs, because it would have the flexibility of allowing more people to be added in as required. They also discussed who would need to be on this conference. [[9/11 Commission, 4/29/2004][4]] But Major Charles Chambers, who is currently on duty in the NMCC, will give a slightly different account. According to Chambers, Staff Sergeant Val Harrison had a phone in her hand and said NORAD was asking for a significant event conference. Leidig had agreed, and so Harrison started establishing the conference. 

**Conference Begins with Recap of Situation** - According to Chambers, "The computer does a mass dialing to connect to those command centers that are always included" in an NMCC conference call, but Harrison also had to manually call the civilian agencies that were going to be included in the conference, such as the FAA, the FBI, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). [[US Department of Defense, 9/2001][5]] The conference then begins at 9:29 a.m. with a brief recap: Two aircraft have hit the WTC, there is a confirmed hijacking of Flight 11, and fighter jets have been scrambled from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts (see [8:46 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a846scramble)). The FAA is asked to provide an update, but its line is silent as the agency has not yet been added to the call (see [(9:29 a.m.-12:00 p.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a929nmccstruggles)). A minute later, Leidig states that it has just been confirmed that Flight 11 is still airborne and is heading toward Washington, DC. (This incorrect information apparently arose minutes earlier during a conference call between FAA centers (see [9:21 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a921flight11mistake)).) [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 37][2]] NMCC conference calls are moderated by the DDO. [[9/11 Commission, 7/21/2003][6]] Leidig will tell the 9/11 Commission that they are conducted over "a special phone circuit, and it's classified to be able to pass information, relay information between very senior leadership all the way over to the White House." [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][7]]

**NMCC Struggled to Convene Conference** - Some officers currently on duty in the NMCC will later complain about circumstances that delayed the establishing of the significant event conference. Chambers will recall that the conference took "much longer than expected to bring up." [[US Department of Defense, 9/2001][5]] Gardner will tell the 9/11 Commission that the NMCC had been "struggling to build the conference," which "didn't get off as quickly as hoped." [[9/11 Commission, 5/5/2004][8]] He will describe his "frustration that it wasn't brought up more quickly." [[9/11 Commission, 5/12/2004][9]]

**Other Conference and Connection Problems Delayed Call** - Preparations for the conference were disrupted as a result of the CIA convening a National Operations and Intelligence Watch Officer Network (NOIWON) conference call between government agencies in the Washington area, reportedly at sometime between 9:16 a.m. and 9:25 a.m. (see [(Between 9:16 a.m. and 9:25 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a916noiwoncall)). According to a 9/11 Commission memorandum, the NMCC had "abandoned its attempt to convene a [significant event conference] so its watch officers could participate in the NOIWON conference." [[Federal Aviation Administration, 9/11/2001][10]; [Federal Aviation Administration, 9/11/2001][11]; [9/11 Commission, 7/21/2003][6]] Another factor that slowed attempts to convene the significant event conference was a problem with connecting some agencies to it. According to Chambers, "A couple of the civil agencies couldn't be reached and others kept dropping off moments after connecting." He will recall, "We finally decided to proceed without those agencies that were having phone problems." [[US Department of Defense, 9/2001][5]] Leidig had announced that the NMCC would have to start without those agencies and add them to the conference later on. [[9/11 Commission, 5/12/2004][9]]

**Call Ends after Five Minutes** - The significant event conference ends after only a few minutes, following a recommendation by NORAD that it be reconvened as an "air threat conference." It is brought to an end at around 9:34 a.m., and will resume as an air threat conference at 9:37 a.m. (see [9:37 a.m.-9:39 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a937airthreatconference)).
