According to the later claims of several senior officials, the US military is tracking Flight 93 as it heads east and is ready to shoot it down if necessary. 
* According to Brigadier General Montague Winfield, the Pentagon's National Military Command Center (NMCC) has "received the report from the FAA that Flight 93 had turned off its transponder, had turned, and was now heading towards Washington, DC." Winfield will add, "The decision was made to try to go intercept Flight 93." [[ABC News, 9/11/2002][1]]
* General Richard Myers, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will write that in the NMCC, "We learned that there was apparently a fourth hijacked aircraft, United Airlines Flight 93 out of Newark, bound nonstop for San Francisco. Like the other planes, it had switched off its transponder, making it much harder if not impossible to track on ground radar." [[Myers, 2009, pp. 152][2]]
* Major General Larry Arnold, the commander of the Continental United States NORAD Region, will say, "I was personally anxious to see what 93 was going to do, and our intent was to intercept it." Three fighters have taken off from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia (see [9:25 a.m.-9:30 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a930langleylaunch)). According to Arnold, "we launched the aircraft out of Langley to put them over top of Washington, DC, not in response to American Airline 77, but really to put them in position in case United 93 were to head that way." [[9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003][4]] He says, "as we discussed it in the conference call, we decided not to move fighters toward 93 until it was closer because there could have been other aircraft coming in," but adds, "I had every intention of shooting down United 93 if it continued to progress toward Washington, DCâ€¦ whether we had authority or not." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 73][5]]
* Colonel Robert Marr, the battle commander at NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS), is reportedly "focused on United Flight 93, headed straight toward Washington." He will concur with Arnold, saying: "United Airlines Flight 93 would not have hit Washington, DC. He would have been engaged and shot down before he got there." [[Filson, 2003, pp. 73][5]] Marr and Arnold will both say they were tracking Flight 93 even earlier on, while it was still heading west (see [Shortly Before 9:36 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a936noradmonitoring)). 

Yet, contradicting these claims, the 9/11 Commission will conclude that the military only learns about Flight 93 around the time it crashes. It says the NMCC learns of the hijacking at 10:03 a.m. (see [10:03 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1003nmcclearns)). Based upon official records, including recordings of the NEADS operations floor, it says NEADS never follows Flight 93 on radar and is first alerted to it at 10:07 a.m. (see [10:05 a.m.-10:08 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a1007clevelandupdate)).
