In the lobby of Building 7 of the WTC, EMS Division Chief John Peruggia is in discussion with Fire Department Captain Richard Rotanz and a representative from the Department of Buildings. As Peruggia later describes, "It was brought to my attention, it was believed that the structural damage that was suffered to the [Twin] Towers was quite significant and they were very confident that the building's stability was compromised and they felt that the North Tower was in danger of a near imminent collapse." Peruggia grabs EMT Richard Zarrillo and tells him to pass on the message "that the buildings have been compromised, we need to evacuate, they're going to collapse." Zarrillo heads out to the fire command post, situated in front of 3 World Financial, the American Express Building, where he relays this message to several senior firefighters. He says, "OEM says the buildings are going to collapse; we need to get out." (OEM is the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, which has its headquarters in WTC 7.) Fire Chief Pete Ganci's response is, "who the f___ told you that?" Seconds later, they hear the noise of the South Tower as it collapses. [[City of New York, 10/23/2001][1]; [City of New York, 10/25/2001][2]; [City of New York, 10/25/2001][3]; [City of New York, 11/9/2001][4]] Others also appear to have been aware of the imminent danger. Fire Chief Joseph Pfeifer, who is at the command post in the lobby of the North Tower, says, "Right before the South Tower collapsed, I noticed a lot of people just left the lobby, and I heard we had a crew of all different people, high-level people in government, everybody was gone, almost like they had information that we didn't have." He says some of them are moving to a new command post across the street. [[City of New York, 10/23/2001][5]; [Firehouse Magazine, 4/2002][6]; [Dwyer and Flynn, 2005, pp. 214][7]] Mayor Giuliani also says he receives a prior warning of the first collapse, while at his temporary headquarters at 75 Barclay Street (see [(Before 9:59 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a959toldcollapse)).
