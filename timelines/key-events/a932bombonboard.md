At the FAA's Cleveland Center, an air traffic controller hears a transmission, presumably made by Flight 93 hijacker-pilot Ziad Jarrah, stating: "Ladies and gentlemen: Here the captain, please sit down, keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board. So, sit." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 12][1]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 39][2]] As the 9/11 Commission later notes, "Like [Mohamed] Atta on Flight 11, Jarrah apparently did not know how to operate the communication radios; thus his attempts to communicate with the passengers were broadcast on the [air traffic control] channel." [[9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 98][2]] While this communication is assumed to have come from Flight 93, an early FAA report states that it came "from an unknown origin." [[Federal Aviation Administration, 9/17/2001][3]] According to Newsweek, just prior to the communication, Cleveland Center controllers heard the sound of screaming from the flight. [[Newsweek, 9/22/2001][4]] The 9/11 Commission states that, around the time of the transmission, the plane's cockpit voice recording indicates "that a woman, most likely a flight attendant, was being held captive in the cockpit. She struggled with one of the hijackers who killed or otherwise silenced her." [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 12][1]; [9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 39][2]] Though the Cleveland air traffic controller understands the hijacker's communication, he responds to it: "Calling Cleveland Center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." He also notifies his supervisor who passes the information up the chain of command, and the FAA's Command Center is subsequently informed, "United 93 may have a bomb on board." At 9:34 the Command Center will relay this information to FAA headquarters (see [9:34 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a934heaquarterstold)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 28][1]]
