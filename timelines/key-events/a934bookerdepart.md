President Bush's motorcade leaves the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, to take Bush and his entourage to Air Force One, but it initially heads in the wrong direction and has to turn around in order to proceed toward the airport. [[Washington Times, 10/8/2002][1]; [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 9/10/2006][2]] Bush has just participated in a reading demonstration at the school (see [9:02 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a903danielsclass)) and given a brief statement to the nation in which he addressed the attacks on the World Trade Center (see [9:30 a.m. September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a929speech)). [[White House, 9/11/2001][3]; [Associated Press, 8/25/2002][4]] He now heads out of the school and gets into his limousine, which then speeds off to take him to his plane. [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 98-99][5]; [LBJ Presidential Library, 9/3/2013][6]] Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport, where Air Force One is waiting, is three and a half miles away from the school. [[Wall Street Journal, 3/22/2004][7]; [Studies in Intelligence, 9/2006][8]] Bush's motorcade drives there much faster than it normally travels. Whereas it usually goes at around 40 to 45 miles per hour, on this occasion the vehicles are driven at 80 to 85 miles per hour. [[LBJ Presidential Library, 9/3/2013][6]] However, it initially speeds off in the wrong direction and, after several kilometers, the vehicles have to perform a U-turn in order to head toward the airport. [[9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004][9]; [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 9/10/2006][2]] During the journey, Bush notices people at the sides of the road, smiling and waving at him, apparently unaware of the crisis that is taking place. [[Sammon, 2002, pp. 98][5]] The Secret Service is concerned that he might be attacked on his way to the airport and provides a high level of security for him during the journey (see (Between [(Between 9:35 a.m. and 9:43 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a935motorcadesecurity)). [[BBC, 9/1/2002][10]; [Rove, 2010, pp. 251][11]; [Politico Magazine, 9/9/2016][12]] Bush will learn about the attack on the Pentagon while he is being driven to the airport (see [(Between 9:38 a.m. and 9:43 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a938bushlearns)). His motorcade will arrive at the airport between 9:42 a.m. and 9:45 a.m. (see [(9:43 a.m.) September 11, 2001](/timeline/#a943motorcade)). [[9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 39][13]]
