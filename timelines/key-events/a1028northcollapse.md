The North Tower of the World Trade Center tilts to the south and then collapses. Its north side was hit by Flight 11 at 8:46, 102 minutes earlier. [[CNN, 9/12/2001][1]; [MSNBC, 9/22/2001][2]; [Kim and Baum, 2002][3]; [Associated Press, 8/21/2002][4]; [National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 33](http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=909017)] After the antenna starts to move (see [(10:28 a.m. September 11, 2001)](/timeline/#a1028antenna)), the next sign that the top section of the building is moving downward is on floor 98, at the top of the impact zone. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology, 9/2005, pp. 22, 87][5]] The angle of the tilt will be disputed after 9/11 (see [September-November 2005](/timeline/#a0905tiltdispute)), as will the time it takes the towers to fall to the ground (see [September 12, 2001-September 2005](/timeline/#a091201collapsetimedispute)). [[Scientific American, 10/9/2001][6]; [Eagar and Musso, 12/2001][7]; [PBS Nova, 5/2002][8]; [National Institute of Standards and Technology, 8/30/2006][9]] The death toll could have been much worseâ€”an estimated 15,000 people made it out of the WTC to safety after 8:46 a.m. [[St. Petersburg Times, 9/8/2002][10]]
